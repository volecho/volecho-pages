Known for her soul-stirring, piano-driven ballads, Avery has amassed over 100 million streams, cementing her place as a voice of raw, relatable storytelling.</p><p data-start="438" data-end="988">With its minimalist production and hauntingly beautiful vocals, “the boys who don’t know what they want” captures the frustration and vulnerability of navigating almost-relationships—those confusing connections where words and actions never quite align. “The title says it all,” Avery explains. “I wrote this about those situations where someone acts like they want a relationship but won’t commit—or the ones who want it but won’t act on it. It’s not necessarily sad, just a reality we’ve all seen and don’t want to keep experiencing.”</p><p class="align-center" data-start="438" data-end="988"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7ejsOM6vM20LCgU6vyvYkN?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="990" data-end="1242">A sister-song to her fan-favorite track “you’re just a guy,” this latest release reinforces Avery’s ability to turn life’s everyday heartaches into poetic reflections, striking a chord with listeners who have been in the same emotional limbo.</p><p data-start="1244" data-end="1656">Originally from Pennsylvania, Avery began composing music at just seven years old, with the piano as her storytelling companion. Now based in Los Angeles, her signature sound—delicate yet deeply expressive—remains at the heart of her artistry. Every song starts with Avery at her piano, crafting heartfelt demos that evolve into the lush, melancholic soundscapes fans have come to love.</p><p data-start="1658" data-end="2024">Described as a “happy girl filled with sad songs,” Avery weaves personal experiences, pop culture, and emotional nuance into every lyric. With acclaim from outlets like Just Jared and EARMILK and a growing army of devoted listeners, her recent signing with RECORDS (Sony Music) marks a new era—one that promises even greater heights for this rising star.</p><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"><div class="related"><h2 class="related__title">Related posts:</h2><ul class="related__items"><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/ja-lena-releases-bold-new-single-ana-elli-hena/">JA Lena Releases Bold New Single “Ana Elli Hena”</a></h3></li><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/tralalas-find-fire-in-the-fragile-with-burns/">TRALALAS Find Fire in the Fragile With “Burns”</a></h3></li><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/moletrap-find-their-voice-with-mid-welsh-pt-1/">Moletrap Find Their Voice With Mid Welsh, Pt 1</a></h3></li></ul></div><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
