The end product is something that can move seamlessly through the decades, assisted by the vocal quality of Journey Eiland and the musical expertise of Ouiwey Collins. It harkens back to The Drifters but in no way seems dated, more in line with today’s holiday albums that know that one does not have to incorporate irony in order to have fun.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5bKjdxCEP8d0eZzhosPxsp?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br><br>What makes this release stand out is the way it relates to the animated version of the same name, produced by DPB. It feels like something you would watch with the family on a Sunday afternoon, something that promotes kindness rather than flashiness.<br>There is a genuine quality to this release that seeps right throughout, something that is clean rather than clinical, something positive without shelling out too much in terms of the message itself.<br><br>The fact that DPB comes from a long line of faith-based musicians lends credibility to the track. This is, after all, more than just a goodwill gesture but rather a body of work that is founded upon community, faith, and encouragement. His voice is credible, and all he had to do was sit back and let the music speak.<br><br>Fans of traditional holiday compilations or movies like “It’s a Wonderful Life” will find a sense of familiarity here. Of course, many will also recognize that fans of Chance in a more musing/minimal guise will find a balance between beat and message. “The Wonders of Christmas” always keeps in mind a reminder of holiday music having a sense of substance.</p><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"><div class="related"><h2 class="related__title">Related posts:</h2><ul class="related__items"><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/interview-with-neverskin/">Interview with Neverskin</a></h3></li><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/eleri-ward-steps-into-her-own-with-internal-rituals/">Eleri Ward Steps Into Her Own With Internal Rituals</a></h3></li><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/tralalas-find-fire-in-the-fragile-with-burns/">TRALALAS Find Fire in the Fragile With “Burns”</a></h3></li></ul></div><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
