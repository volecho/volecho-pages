Born in Hong Kong, raised in San Francisco, educated in Britain, the artist has never regarded music as mere sound—it's world-building. Her songs sit in the crossroads of a movie soundtrack and dance floor, where global beats and classical orchestration mingle with narrative emotion. Now, with her latest release Labyrinth Of Life (Eddie Craig Remix) releasing October 25 on On QiiA Media, Qymira reimagines power, vulnerability, and cinematic scale for the fourth time.<br><br>The song is one of a string of chart-topping hits from the artist, such as Wait For No One, Give It To Me, and Brazilian hit radio favorites Perdão, Sun &amp; Sea, and Vem Comigo. But Labyrinth Of Life is different. It's heavier, darker, and more introspective—less about escaping, more about confronting what's beneath the surface. The track joins Qymira's authoritative vocals with snappy production from Eddie Craig—he's half of UK electronic duo The Wideboys, who've produced for Rihanna, Kylie Minogue, and Girls Aloud. Add in a verse by ItzDvn, whose delivery brings the grit to this song, and you've got something that is simultaneously spiritual and physical, mental and club-danceable.<br><br>Labyrinth Of Life is a thematically deconstructionist song. It's an invitation to wake up—to draw back the curtain on all that is artificial, surface-level, performative. Qymira describes it as "a search for truth and clarity through a labyrinth of distractions." But this is not sanctimonious cogitating; this is an anthem that succeeds. The orchestral arrangement, composed and arranged by Qymira herself with the assistance of the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra, raises a dance track to something exalted. It's Inception and The Matrix in their heads if they were being sound-tracked for an electronic opera. You can picture this track ending an episode of Euphoria or thumping through a late-night Drive montage—neon glows on wet pavement, all a little dreamlike but very real.<br><br>This drop follows hard on the heels of Melodrama (RainForest Edit), another with Eddie Craig that took her first orchestral single and remixed it as an ecstasy dance edit. It pared the sound back to staccato synths and rhythmic chunk but retained Qymira's magnetic vocals at the forefront. That track was one about illusion and manipulation—dynamics of power that distort relationships. Labyrinth Of Life blows open that world, takes individualized chaos and universalizes it. It's not one relationship now; it's systems we inhabit and the identities we construct within them.<br><br>Qymira's ascent has been anything but conventional. Classically trained on violin, piano, and voice since childhood, she was already leading orchestras as a teenager. Her debut single Satisfied made No. 1 in the UK Music Week Breakers Chart and propelled her onto a UK tour that saw her performing in front of tens of thousands. She has since conducted members of premier orchestras throughout Asia and had her music performed on the world's stages. The music she is making today—this union of classical grandeur, global beat, and electronic bite—sounds like the natural extension of that tradition.</p><p class="align-center"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on October 15, 2025</p><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="inverse" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3><p><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://volecho.com/benjamin-quartz-lights-the-fire-with-pyromane/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/69/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-13-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5">Benjamin Quartz Lights the Fire with &#x27;Pyromane&#x27;</h3></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://volecho.com/bill-barlow-passes-the-baton-to-the-fans-with-by-special-request/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="content__nav__text">Next Post<h3 class="h5">Bill Barlow Passes the Baton to the Fans with &#x27;By Special Request&#x27;</h3></div><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/71/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-15-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/tralalas-find-fire-in-the-fragile-with-burns/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/33/responsive/Untitled-design-1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/tralalas-find-fire-in-the-fragile-with-burns/" class="inverse">TRALALAS Find Fire in the Fragile With “Burns”</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T12:41">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/marzanna-breathes-strange-new-life-into-the-familiar/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/32/responsive/Marzanna-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/marzanna-breathes-strange-new-life-into-the-familiar/" class="inverse">Marzanna Breathes Strange New Life Into the Familiar</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T12:34">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/moletrap-find-their-voice-with-mid-welsh-pt-1/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/31/responsive/moletrap-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/moletrap-find-their-voice-with-mid-welsh-pt-1/" class="inverse">Moletrap Find Their Voice With Mid Welsh, Pt 1</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T12:26">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__newsletter newsletter"><p class="newsletter__note">Get the latest QF news, updates and more delivered<br>directly to your email inbox</p><form>...</form></div><a class="logo" href="https://volecho.com/">volecho.com</a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
