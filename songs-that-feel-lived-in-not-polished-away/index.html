In terms of release, it was part of the album “Perspectives.” It speaks of experience but does this without ever feeling rather preachy. It uses the strength of its melody and its deliberate pace to press onward like someone who knows enough to no longer put on the face that optimism always comes easily. The sound has a quality of openness that allows the message to sink in.<br><br>JCCutter is New Mexico-raised and has honed their writing style through years of travel, so their words have all the earmarks of someone who is listening before speaking. The song is all about strength in numbers, and this is an affirmation, not a rallying cry, but a discovery made through experience. It has that reflective quality of artists such as Ben Howard or young Ryan Adams, whose work says so much through restraint as opposed to volume. The chorus is built for road trips or for dark nights of the soul, where all that matters is some measure of assurance that all is right with the world.<br><br>As a collective work, "Perspectives as a whole presents resilience as something shared, not heroic." This installment in particular belongs among movies such as "Into the Wild" and "Nomadland" in terms of narratives that reside in perseverance and linking, rather than triumph. "JCCutter recognizes this: survival happens in ways that are unremarkable, frequently slow-going, and done in tandem." "We Live Through It All does not offer easy answers, but it does not lack company, either."<br><br>“For those listenerswho respond to good songwriting, who respect silence as much as sound, there is a record here that is worth spending some time on. It is a record that trusts the listener, and that feeling stays.”<br><br><hr><strong>HIDE AND SEEK, KILL THE SILENCE Turn Cinema Panic Into Post Hardcore Fire</strong><br><br>Kill The Silence are back with Hide and Seek, and they are honed in on their sound in a way that has never been louder or more focused. The single is inspired by the movie Ready Or Not but takes that high stakes chase as a way to explore their own themes of fear, control, and survival. The band gets straight to work in painting a sonic landscape. The guitars are sharp, the drums are precise, and the vocals are a perfect combination of melody and intimidation delivered by Jason Walsh.<br><br>Born out of Leeds and bred on the sing-along punch of the likes of Lower Than Atlantis or Deaf Havana, Kill The Silence have never forgotten the strength of massive hooks and genuine aggression. "Hide And Seek" feels like the obvious progression of what the band have been doing so well on tracks such as "All We Are" - the production is clear but not over-sanitized.<br><br>There is a cinematic element to this that definitely puts me in mind of thriller movies or late night horror binges, the type that are as much about build and atmosphere as they are scares. People who like the more pop-oriented side of Bring Me The Horizon or the early work of Don Broco will be comfortable.<br><br>As a return, Hide and Seek does have big expectations to live up to in 2026. It represents a band that has not rushed but has developed. Kill The Silence appear to be prepared to reclaim their ground, not by being louder than everyone else, but by sounding like they know where they are going.<br><br><hr><strong>Albrecht Street, _Sophie Penman writes home into song_.</strong><br><br>Albert Street is a subdued but assured comeback for Sophie Penman, and perhaps this is her best work to date. Written from outside of Edinburgh, it captures very well the bittersweet comfort of home streets viewed anew.<br><br>The voice is warmly central, accompanied by piano and guitar that play subsidiary rather than central roles. Everything is deliberate but never formalized or clinical.<br><br>The sense of calm, considered delivery is, too, evocative of, say, Eva Cassidy singing, or Norah Jones, but Penman’s upbringing in Scotland brings a specific flavor. There is also a sense of folk singing lurking beneath the melody, which brings a sense of location. The production is all about warmth and ambience, letting the listener inhabit the story, rather than focussing on a hook. “Albert Street” is reminiscent of walking back home in the evening and observing details that were not noticed in the past. It suits its company in terms of being similar to Before Sunrise, Once, where stories can revolve around reflection and minimal change in the emotional status of the characters. Penman realizes that change can take place in subtle ways. With experience playing on stages from Edinburgh Castle to Cannes under her belt, Penman’s restraint is no newcomer’s game. This one artist seems to be the sort to let the song happen at its own speed. For those listeners seeking songwriters to tap into the human moment for a more raw experience, *Albert Street* is a reminder to listen.</div><div> </div><div><hr><strong>ANGELS, Annika Bellamy sings between worlds</strong><br><br>Angels discovers Annika Bellamy in a introspective state, crafting a bilingual lament that is personal in nature but also universal. Recorded in her Southern California home, the single uses English and Spanish effortlessly, in harmony with her background and feelings. The melody is soft but assertive, propelled forward by a voice that effortlessly transitions from soft to strong.<br><br>This song was co-produced with Jayden Panesso and also features contributions from some guitar work by Todd Meikle, and its production orientation is to intimacy over grandness. Every single note is right there, as if this song was recorded at some late hours of the night where all thoughts are present there. The words of this song show its focus on both loss and attachment, celebrating its subjects without getting too sentimental.<br><br>Bellamy’s own experience, from family connections to Redbone’s success, is implicit in the song but does not overpower the track. Angels fits neatly between contemplative seasonal releases or films that choose to remember as a mode of love rather than grief, as with Coco.<br><br>It is, therefore, not a seasonal track per se. It is more subdued, introspective, but all the more effective because of that. Annika Bellamy is again making a space characterized by honesty and emotional directness. Angels is, in fact, an experience that is being shared, not performed, which makes it so effective.<br><br><hr><strong>SEASONS, Zeek Wonderlen Lets RnB Change with the Weather</strong><br><br>Zeek Wonderlen's Seasons is an EP that carries the deliberateness of an artist aware that progress does not always happen at breakneck speed. From first to last, Seasons finds the Chicagoan combining elements of smooth R&amp;B with hip-hop production smarts, refusing to let his work conform to any particularly trendy mold in favor of letting his feelings dictate the terms.<br><br>Exposed to an assortment of sounds and delivered via live performances, Wonderlen’s songwriting about love and pain flows as if it were second nature. It’s comforting in its delivery, as if the artist were working out an idea in his mind instead of proclaiming it. The EP has the feel of artists such as Anderson Paak or Childish Gambino in its early stages, with melody and rhythm used to tell a story.<br><br>However, Seasons is definitely an album that needs to be played in full, as each song encapsulates a level of feeling that exists in each season. It would definitely be suitable to late night drives, maybe films such as Moonlight, in which the feeling develops gradually. Wonderlen’s radio and film experience definitely comes through in his understanding of pace. Being versed in the company of heavy-hitters and maintaining a connection with his hometown, Zeek Wonderlen sounds like someone with his feet on the ground and his ears open. *Seasons* does not seek the spotlight, it takes it. A recommendation to those listening who are in the market for some RnB with heart over hype.</div></nav></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on December 29, 2025</p><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="inverse" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3><p><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://volecho.com/voices-shaped-by-distance-loss-and-late-hours/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/108/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-44-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5">Voices Shaped by Distance, Loss, and Late Hours</h3></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://volecho.com/three-ways-to-say-it-out-loud-vulnerability-volume-and-self-made-vision/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="content__nav__text">Next Post<h3 class="h5">Three Ways To Say It Out Loud: Vulnerability, Volume, And Self-Made Vision</h3></div><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/110/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-46-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/dizzy-panda-blur-the-human-line-with-a-nervy-late-night-album-that-refuses-easy-answers/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/102/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-38-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/dizzy-panda-blur-the-human-line-with-a-nervy-late-night-album-that-refuses-easy-answers/" class="inverse">Dizzy Panda Blur The Human Line With A Nervy, Late Night Album That Refuses Easy Answers</a></h4><time datetime="2025-12-26T01:14">December 26, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/pointe-step-through-the-fog-with-guard-rails-a-debut-that-waits-tightens-and-finally-sparks/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/96/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/pointe-step-through-the-fog-with-guard-rails-a-debut-that-waits-tightens-and-finally-sparks/" class="inverse">Pointe Step Through the Fog With Guard Rails, A Debut That Waits, Tightens, and Finally Sparks</a></h4><time datetime="2025-11-25T13:12">November 25, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/songs-built-from-scrapes-and-sparks-five-artists-rewriting-their-own-stories/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/92/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-30-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/songs-built-from-scrapes-and-sparks-five-artists-rewriting-their-own-stories/" class="inverse">Songs Built From Scrapes and Sparks: Five Artists Rewriting Their Own Stories</a></h4><time datetime="2025-11-17T23:39">November 17, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__newsletter newsletter"><p class="newsletter__note">Get the latest QF news, updates and more delivered<br>directly to your email inbox</p><form>...</form></div><a class="logo" href="https://volecho.com/">volecho.com</a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
