This album is my attempt to capture those fleeting, often neglected emotions.”</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5qFHOhuR64kspZz2x05LHv?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p>Recorded between Los Angeles and Toronto over the past year, sunsetto’s journey to this milestone has been met with growing acclaim. His recent singles have resonated deeply with a new generation of pop fans, his poignant storytelling and genre-blurring sound marking him as an artist to watch.</p><p>Among the standout tracks is <em>CROSSFIRE</em>, a poignant anthem co-written and produced by 9AM (Leon Bridges, Noah Cyrus). With haunting melodies and raw lyricism, the song encapsulates sunsetto’s signature style. “It’s about lost potential and the choices that define us,” he shares. “That feeling of being caught between dreams and reality is something I’ve lived, and I wanted to bring that honesty into my music.”</p><p>Blending emotional depth with sonic innovation, sunsetto is carving a distinct lane in the alt-pop space. With <em>The Sun, The Moon &amp; The Big Machine</em>, he invites listeners on an intimate journey through his world—one where every lyric, beat, and melody tells a story of passion, struggle, and self-discovery.</p><p>Stream <em>The Sun, The Moon &amp; The Big Machine</em> now:<br><a href="https://sunsetto.lnk.to/SMBM" disabled="disabled">https://sunsetto.lnk.to/SMBM</a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Meet sunsetto: The Genre-Defying Artist Behind the Music</strong></h3><p>Few artists capture the spirit of their generation like Toronto-based singer, songwriter, and producer sunsetto (Kyle Mischiek). Raised on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, he split his time between music and skateboarding, forging a creative path that would shape his sound. Initially dabbling in rap and beat-making during high school, he refined his craft at prestigious songwriting camps led by GRAMMY® and JUNO Award-winning songwriter Gordie Sampson (Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban).</p><p>His breakout moment came in 2020 with the viral success of his debut single <em>don’t leave</em>, amassing hundreds of thousands of streams and catching the attention of tastemakers like EARMILK and Fashionably Early. His distinctive fusion of dance, rap, R&amp;B, and modern country—paired with lyrics that oscillate between euphoria and deep introspection—has solidified his place in the alt-pop landscape.</p><p>This year’s string of releases, including <em>PLANS</em>, <em>POTENTIAL</em>, <em>GREEN TEXTS</em>, <em>DON’T LEAVE ME BEHIND</em> (feat. Sinéad Harnett), <em>BIG MACHINE</em>, and <em>SHE’S THE WHOLE WORLD</em>, showcases his evolving artistry and connection to a new wave of pop listeners. Now, with <em>The Sun, The Moon &amp; The Big Machine</em>, sunsetto embarks on his most ambitious chapter yet—one that cements his status as a force to be reckoned with in modern music.</p><p> </p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://volecho.com/new-music-by-vanarin/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">VANARIN’s Mesmerizing New Release: A Taste of Their Upcoming Third Album</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://volecho.com/maddie-regent-unveils-the-hauntingly-beautiful-turtleneck-ahead-of-debut-album/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Maddie Regent Unveils the Hauntingly Beautiful “Turtleneck” Ahead of Debut Album</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="banner banner--after-post"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></div><div class="post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Related posts</h2><div class="l-grid l-grid--4"><article class="c-card"><a href="https://volecho.com/maddie-regent-unveils-the-hauntingly-beautiful-turtleneck-ahead-of-debut-album/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/24/unnamed-1.jpg" srcset="https://volecho.com/media/posts/24/responsive/unnamed-1-xs.jpg 300w, https://volecho.com/media/posts/24/responsive/unnamed-1-sm.jpg 480w, https://volecho.com/media/posts/24/responsive/unnamed-1-md.jpg 768w, https://volecho.com/media/posts/24/responsive/unnamed-1-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 56.25em) 100vw, (min-width: 37.5em) 50vw, 100vw" loading="lazy" height="1667" width="2500" alt=""></a><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://volecho.com/maddie-regent-unveils-the-hauntingly-beautiful-turtleneck-ahead-of-debut-album/" class="invert">Maddie Regent Unveils the Hauntingly Beautiful “Turtleneck” Ahead of Debut Album</a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2025-03-31T00:31">March 31, 2025</time><div class="c-card__comments"><svg aria-hidden="true"><title>Comments</title><use xlink:href="https://volecho.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#comments"/></svg> <a href="https://volecho.com/maddie-regent-unveils-the-hauntingly-beautiful-turtleneck-ahead-of-debut-album/#post-comments" data-disqus-identifier="24" class="invert" rel="nofollow">0</a></div></footer></div></article></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright 2025</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
