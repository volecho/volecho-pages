This album is my attempt to capture those fleeting, often neglected emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5qFHOhuR64kspZz2x05LHv?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Recorded between Los Angeles and Toronto over the past year, sunsetto’s journey to this milestone has been met with growing acclaim. His recent singles have resonated deeply with a new generation of pop fans, his poignant storytelling and genre-blurring sound marking him as an artist to watch.</p>\n<p>Among the standout tracks is <em>CROSSFIRE</em>, a poignant anthem co-written and produced by 9AM (Leon Bridges, Noah Cyrus). With haunting melodies and raw lyricism, the song encapsulates sunsetto’s signature style. “It’s about lost potential and the choices that define us,” he shares. “That feeling of being caught between dreams and reality is something I’ve lived, and I wanted to bring that honesty into my music.”</p>\n<p>Blending emotional depth with sonic innovation, sunsetto is carving a distinct lane in the alt-pop space. With <em>The Sun, The Moon &amp; The Big Machine</em>, he invites listeners on an intimate journey through his world—one where every lyric, beat, and melody tells a story of passion, struggle, and self-discovery.</p>\n<p>Stream <em>The Sun, The Moon &amp; The Big Machine</em> now:<br><a href=\"https://sunsetto.lnk.to/SMBM\" disabled=\"disabled\">https://sunsetto.lnk.to/SMBM</a></p>\n<div><hr></div>\n<h3><strong>Meet sunsetto: The Genre-Defying Artist Behind the Music</strong></h3>\n<p>Few artists capture the spirit of their generation like Toronto-based singer, songwriter, and producer sunsetto (Kyle Mischiek). Raised on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, he split his time between music and skateboarding, forging a creative path that would shape his sound. Initially dabbling in rap and beat-making during high school, he refined his craft at prestigious songwriting camps led by GRAMMY® and JUNO Award-winning songwriter Gordie Sampson (Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban).</p>\n<p>His breakout moment came in 2020 with the viral success of his debut single <em>don’t leave</em>, amassing hundreds of thousands of streams and catching the attention of tastemakers like EARMILK and Fashionably Early. His distinctive fusion of dance, rap, R&amp;B, and modern country—paired with lyrics that oscillate between euphoria and deep introspection—has solidified his place in the alt-pop landscape.</p>\n<p>This year’s string of releases, including <em>PLANS</em>, <em>POTENTIAL</em>, <em>GREEN TEXTS</em>, <em>DON’T LEAVE ME BEHIND</em> (feat. Sinéad Harnett), <em>BIG MACHINE</em>, and <em>SHE’S THE WHOLE WORLD</em>, showcases his evolving artistry and connection to a new wave of pop listeners. Now, with <em>The Sun, The Moon &amp; The Big Machine</em>, sunsetto embarks on his most ambitious chapter yet—one that cements his status as a force to be reckoned with in modern music.</p>\n<p> </p>",

As best put by Nashville Socialite, it's an \"absolute knockout\" of fresh country-pop peppered with a healthy dose of 90s girl-power nostalgia. Twinnie's carefree yet reflective lyrics meander through love, possibilities, and the unspoken \"what-ifs,\" while channeling her trademark warmth and confidence-a mix of strengths and vulnerabilities not unlike those embodied by none other than Shania Twain herself.

Her Manchester show has already sold out.</p>\n<p><br>Last year, Twinnie joined the cast of Emmerdale to play Jade, the mean boxing promoter. On her latest role, Twinnie says: \"Life has been crazy juggling acting and music, with lots of back and forth between Nashville and Yorkshire, but I'm loving every second of it!<br><br>No stranger to acting, Twinnie has a history on British television with roles in the shows Doctors and Hollyoaks, where she received much acclaim for her portrayal of Porsche McQueen, whose storyline tackled critical social issues like childhood sexual abuse.<br><br>Twinnie became the first British artist to sing the American National Anthem at the stadium of Nashville SC, GEODIS Park, stamping her credentials as a global star with an infectious dynamism.<br><br>Twinnie's life story has been very far from ordinary. At her tender age, she had acted among giants like Glenn Close and Robin Thicke while her West End performances in Chicago and Rock of Ages hinted at the shining star she was to become.

Something I constantly struggle with. I’ve made a lot of choices to get where I am today and often I’m not sure if I’m actually being true to myself. The song also speaks directly about doubt in previous relationships, whether my heart was actually in it. The video, created by the brilliant Lindsey Blane, really tied this idea together and we deliberately ended it before knowing the answer to the guy’s proposal.

            "content_html": "<p> </p>\n<p>Werner Herzog, director of Aguirre, the Wrath of God, sought a location atop a mountain near Machu Picchu in Peru to shoot the opening scenes. He led his cast and crew of 450 people, together with a procession of horses, pigs, and llamas, up the mountainside. His group slogged down an ancient stairway carved into the rocks by the Incans centuries ago, traveling through dense jungle on steep footing made slick by rain. Clouds blanketed the entire mountain, shrouding everything in dense, moist fog, allowing no visibility. Even the local upland tribes got vertigo-stricken at 14,000 feet, but the players withstood the conditions in their heavy costume armor and Spanish conquistador clothing.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LqdXayZ6Q0?si=iyBRtObuml7TJMpS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The journey appeared impossible. Herzog had to persuade his crew to keep going, to keep ascending higher and higher along a vertical drop of almost 2,000 feet. Herzog was concerned that their efforts had been in vain when they arrived at their destination. The clouds eventually cleared, and daylight broke through. Herzog got his shots, capturing a line of actors, barely specks in the frame, descending down the Incan stairway between a severe mountain slope and a cloud of fog. Herzog believed a miracle had occurred. He reflected on his good fortune, saying, \"It was on this day that I definitely came to know my destiny.\" Ironically, it was that kind of mad determination and assumption of fate that pushed his film's zealous protagonist, Lope de Aguirre.</p>\n<p>Before he was recognized for filming documentaries like Grizzly Man (2005) and Encounters at the End of the World (2008) about people consumed by passion in remote, unattainable locales, Herzog made narrative films about the same subject, demonstrating that he shared their obsession. Aguirre, the Wrath of God was Herzog's first such picture, as well as his first international hit outside of his own West Germany. His 1972 film depicts a failed Spanish voyage to find El Dorado, the legendary Incan city of gold.</p>\n<h3>A fever dream</h3>\n<p>On the surface, the film looks to be a traditional period adventure about the fight between humans and nature, with Spanish conquistadors venturing into the unknown to collect treasure, only to be defeated by the unconquered forest. However, upon closer observation, the entire picture is set in a fever dream of obsessive urges. After all, what better example of crazy than conquistadors marching off in a specified direction with hundreds of troops and resources in tow, hoping to discover a place whose location is unknown and, ultimately, does not exist? Many of Herzog's greatest films feature rebels against both humanity and nature.</p>\n<p>They strive for an unachievable goal, possibly out of pride or vanity, but they are eventually swallowed and regurgitated by Nature. Herzog knew these obsessions better than most; he later experienced them when filming Fitzcarraldo (1982), as well as countless other tales and documentaries, including Aguirre, the Wrath of God. He exhibits his own obsession by directing this ambitious film to follow his subject into the heart of darkness, rather than filming on a studio lot or a safer place.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/mbV6fC2/image.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"image\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<h3>Detachment from reality </h3>\n<p>Herzog never meant to make Aguirre, the Wrath of God into a historical account of Lope de Aguirre's life and times. In reality, his initial concept for the picture was inspired by a children's book that included a brief segment on Aguirre. What captivated the director the most was the figure's complete craziness. When Aguirre joined Don Pedro de Ursúa's expedition to find El Dorado, he already had a reputation for being a vicious and ruthless conquistador. On the trip, Aguirre overcame his superiors and took command. In a manic letter discovered during Herzog's research, Aguirre denounces King Felipe II of Spain, declaring him \"dethroned and stripped of all rights,\" and renaming himself \"the Wrath of God.\"</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/XZ8Qmrr/image.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"image\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p>He went on to declare himself \"the new Emperor of El Dorado and New Spain\" and led his captured expedition into the unknown. Finally, he arrived at the Atlantic, no closer to discovering El Dorado, and all but a few of his followers had died. This daring, this detachment from reality while immersed in nature, drew the director in, and Herzog determined to recreate it in his film. \"Aguirre is one of history's great losers,\" the filmmaker once stated in an interview, and the concept of Aguirre's unusually fixated worldview layered his screenplay more than actual reality. \"The entire script is pure invention,\" Herzog revealed in an interview. What he meant to represent was not facts and dates, but the frame of mind attributed to Aguirre, the type of adventurer who seeks a wealth of riches while also pursuing his own death.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"> </p>",

Whether they’re first or last in the lineup, they will undoubtedly be the band having the most fun. They love what they do and they love doing it with each other, which is why all three members have stuck with the band since the beginning. With an unmatched chemistry that can only be developed with twenty years of friendship, it’s safe to say that this isn’t just a phase. Their new album Last Band Standing will be out in summer 2023 on Montreal-based Thousand Islands Records, and hopefully it will help to take their excellent adventure to the international stage.</p>",

Not regulated to a mere two chords and screaming, the quartet take everything great about punk and pack it into songs varied in structure and melodies that never grow redundant. Their music smells like a sweaty basement show, tastes like cheap beer on a lamp-lit porch and feels like not wanting to go home at the end of the night.</p>",
