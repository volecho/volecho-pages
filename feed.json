            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-center\">Antonio David, a French singer-songwriter, comes back with a very intimate track, “Entre tes mains,” released on January 5th, 2026. Born in Angers, David has produced a track that exudes a great deal of soul and introspection, as well as a desire to push the boundaries offered by modern production techniques.<br><br>Completely recorded in his hometown using only his phone, “Entre tes mains” is a lesson in subtlety and restraint. Underlying it all, of course, is a meeting of soothing piano and passionate saxophone that is as immediate as it is eternal. Every note is precisely placed to complement the lyrics that map the contours of longing and regret without ever venturing into soap operatic territory.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1JNjn97PrqeLES2F563KvE?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div><br><br>What is unique about this release is Antonio's use of technology for artistic purposes. Working with AI technology that assists with lyrics, Antonio combines his experiences with modern technology, creating a story that is specific, poignant, and meaningful. The combination of human emotion with technology assistance comes off as intentional rather than novelty-seeking, which is a testament to an artist open to innovation yet grounded in storytelling.<br><br>*Entre tes mains* is a prime example of a balance between vulnerability and complexity. The vocal performance of David is both delicate and refined, moving the story forward with a sense of truth. The interplay of the sax and piano creates a sense of grandeur to frame the song, drawing the listener into a space where the emotion can be experienced to the fullest. The arrangement of the song has a cinematic quality to it, much like a jazz ballad, yet it is very much rooted in the time it is created.<br><br>For those listeners who enjoy music which is both reflective and well-crafted, *Entre Tes Mains* will prove to be a compelling listen. The minimalistic recording style, combined with the innovative writing of lyrics, indicates a confident artist who isn’t afraid to take a different route. Antonio David remains a testament to the fact that songwriting from the heart and experimenting with technology do not have to be at odds. \"Entre tes mains\" is a highlight in his journey so far—a single that lingers long after its last note has faded away.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-center\">Tony Frissore has always straddled worlds, and his current single, Four Walls, is an expression of this restless curiosity turned inward. Released in 2025 as the last installment of a seven-track set recorded on the road, Four Walls represents a moment of solitude—a feeling of being on the move but alone in your own company. It is a contemplative song but not a sad one, and it maintains its rhythmic pulse even as it explores intimacy.<br><br>As an artist, producer, and long-time aficionado of the genre, Tony’s own personal history is as diverse as the music he creates. From Boston to the jazz scene of New Orleans, and then on to the clubs of the European mainland to network with other DJs and nightclub owners, Tony’s global perspective is reflected in the diverse rhythms and elements of the many styles of music he weaves into his own works. Today, Tony is currently performing as the frontman for the Cleveland-based group Pop Avenue while pursuing his own solo career as an artist.<br><br>Four Walls is at a calmer crossroads of his sound. While tracks such as Just Fade Away and The Eagle Has Landed reach out with energetic urgency and directness, Four Walls looks inward, celebrating the feelings of being enclosed both physically and emotionally. This is a track whose production is full of the dynamics of both motion and stasis at the same time, with delicate electronics underscoring quiet reflection and fleeting memories in the midst of the rush of traveling. It's a track that is very filmic, like the view of the city through the window of a hotel room at night.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/09qTJTEgJU2ivPZhvPjZvD?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div><br><br>Frissore’s work has international reach. His songs have been featured on MTV, Discovery, TLC, HGTV, OWN, and the DIY Network, and Shazammed in more than 150 countries, which shows a rare talent for speaking to everyone while still having a unique voice. *Four Walls*, on the other hand, is a very personal work. It shows a producer with the talent to create both public and private spaces.<br><br>This single is a product of his very productive 2025, in which he produced singles such as Know Yourself, Stand for Freedom, Self Soothe, and Bad Strategies. Through all of these, he is able to shift easily from one genre to another, whether it is EDM, hip-hop, or even the more contemplative down-tempo genre, with years of experience under his belt, from his earlier work in 2008 with The Übermix to his Quarantine Chronicles in 2020. However, Four Walls is unique in its simplicity and emotional depth.<br><br>Listeners familiar with Frissore’s discography will know his unique combination of groove, texture, and melody. Newcomers to his music will find a song that is both intimate and sophisticated, a song that is reflective while also having enough rhythmic propulsion to recall that it is music written by someone who understands the road, both physically and figuratively. \"Four Walls\" is a subtle gem in a vast discography. It is a reminder that in the midst of movement, sound, and the global, it is important to look inward, to observe, to listen, and to create a space where the world recedes and all that is left is the sound and the mind.</p>",

It is an important reminder that sometimes the most powerful moments of music and faith come through the power of spontaneity and simplicity.<br><br>What Eddy Mann has created with \"Oh Come\" is something far greater than a Christmas song; it is a musical moment which captures the quiet joys and reflections at the heart of the season.

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-center\">Whiskey, Ghosts, and Memories does not hurry to get its point across. This six-track EP from Ron the Trucker has the tempo of one who has lived with these stories for long enough to understand that they are not going to fade away simply because you tell them once. This record, which has its foundations in country and Americana, has more of the feel of a chat that takes place late at night.<br><br>Right from the start, it is apparent that this record is intended to be listened to from start to finish. Each song segues nicely into the next, creating an imperfect but deliberate trajectory that follows love, loss, faith, and the quiet accounting of time. These songs are not ones intended to be listened to in isolation. They function best as chapters, each lending weight to those preceding it. In the end, the listener has not only absorbed these songs, but has inhabited an emotional space.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/218to8VPosk7vmuBroznOF?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div><br><br>The writing in the songs of Ron the Trucker is steady and sure. His songs value clarity over cleverness; they state what they have to say directly and in a straightforward way. There is no flowery language in the songs of Ron the Trucker; the words are plain but not empty of meaning. Every word in the songs of Ron the Trucker seems to be well-earned. There is a definite sense of place in the songs of Ron the Trucker; not just physical place but also a sense of a place in the heart where the noise has receded.<br><br>The recording reflects that level of control. Everything is in its proper place, serving the tales rather than upstaging them. The guitars have a played-in quality. The beats are contemplative. Breathing room is given to exist between the phrases, allowing a word to sink in completely before the next idea comes along. It is a reminder of a day when country and Americana albums relied on the song to carry the load.<br><br>What’s most striking, however, is that these songs have a level of emotional realism that’s quite rare. “Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories” isn’t an album that tries to sentimentalize hardship or paper over regret. It’s one that lets faith and doubt occupy the same space. There’s loss, but not in a way that’s traumatic or dramatic. There’s love that’s complicated and lasting, not simplistic and absolute.<br><br>On a spiritual level, the EP fits right in with other minimalist albums by artists such as Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and other songwriters in more contemporary circles who prefer a narrative first approach. There’s a certain element to the record that resonates with films that exist in a state of dialogue over action, in which the meaning is found in the quiet instead of the loud.<br><br>Ron the Trucker’s biography is important. As an independent artist, Ron the Trucker’s work is influenced by long hours and hard work and the experiences of personal loss. His songs demonstrate an awareness of the world and its experiences. There is no hype. There is no downplaying. The songs flow as if you were having a discussion with someone who knows enough to talk carefully.<br><br>The fact that he has founded Broken Soul Records, LLC, in Georgia, and that it is a company that distributes his music, further emphasizes that it is not his intention to produce mainstream music. This artist definitely stands by his ideals of artistic expression and honesty, rather than striving to produce something refined and popular. Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is perfect for listeners who appreciate albums as a complete work, and not necessarily as a compilation of hooks. It will appeal to listeners of introspective country, singer-songwriter albums, and Americana that is based upon storytelling as opposed to spectacle. It is also perfect for playlists and environments where the emphasis is upon meaning and truth as opposed to sound. This EP doesn’t aim to change the world. It undertakes something much more subtle and much harder. It listens to itself and speaks out from it. This gives Ron the Trucker a record that has a solid, lived-in feel to it, and it rings true. If you are looking to hear music that understands the gravity of memories and the solace of telling the truth, then Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is certainly worth your time.</p>",

It is catchy without trying too hard, the kind of track that slides easily onto radio playlists or late afternoon drives. Then comes Wrong With You, which shifts the lights down. The beat slows, the tone darkens, and Joey sinks back into R and B, letting space and restraint do the heavy lifting. His voice sits closer to the listener here, revealing cracks and questions rather than hooks alone.</p>\n<p data-start=\"970\" data-end=\"1387\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Production from Sandro Carr and Mr. Igotbars keeps both songs focused and modern, never cluttered. The contrast works because it feels honest. Fans of artists like Giveon, early The Weeknd, or Justin Timberlake’s moodier cuts will recognize the balance. MISSING IN ACTION plays like a short film with two scenes, one sunlit, one after midnight. It leaves you curious about what comes next, which is exactly the point.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>John Beckmann approaches “The Mortal Prophets” more like a musical entity than a band. Every record is more about atmosphere and setting, with songs playing like episodes from short stories that take place on the highways of the desert or in dimly lit rooms. “Americana” is there, but it’s not nostalgic. It’s like the guitars are worn, the voices are drifting, and the electronic elements are sneaking into the corners.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3Y2UzZ6Uelgt7zmIuWlZ6R?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>Beckmann’s prose is strongly suggestive. The lyrics draw on mysticism, poetry, and late-night trains of thought, leaving room for interpretation. You can hear nods towards Eno and Fripp in the ambient textures, the constant propulsion of kosmische music beneath it all, and glimmers of Pink Floyd in their earlier incarnation in the melodic lines. But it all comes down with a sense of clarity, never succumbing to abstraction for abstraction’s sake.<br><br>For anyone who likes artists such as Nick Cave, David Sylvian, or the darker side of Talk Talk, there is plenty to immerse oneself in here. The Mortal Prophets are a group whose sounds are perhaps better digested slowly, perhaps late at night, in the same way you might view an old film noir or a well-worn novel.<br><br></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Plague Protocol has the sound of a record recorded under a black sky, loud enough to drown out all else. Deathkrush embraces the weight and the size on this record, crafting tracks that have a physicality about them but never losing their form in the process. The guitars churn and writhe, low and thick, a body of tension that never abates. The drumming toggles from all-out sprint to crushing weight, imbuing the record with a vital, organic pulse that keeps the listener on the end of the next beat.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/326lQhg79XzAN3MBXpbsYs?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>The vocals enter with a wash, screaming abrasively against deep, guttural rumbles. There isn’t a sense of frontman swagger, but rather a sense of multiple voices intersecting, ritualistic and feral. Lyrics find Plague Protocol circles collapse, both internal and cosmic, describing destruction as both terrifying and transformative. It recalls the weight of early Gojira, the drama of Fit for an Autopsy, and the bleak scope of contemporary deathcore, but doesn’t derive from any one source.<br><br>This is not background music. *Plague Protocol* requires attention, just as with other movies such as *Road* or *Children of Men*, which immerse you in a pessimistic atmosphere that lingers with you. Listeners seeking something heavy yet well-thought-out rather than just thrown together will appreciate what Deathkrush has to offer.</p>",
