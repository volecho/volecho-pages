His newest single Feel, the successor to his initial Midas, is the instant an artist comes to terms after years in hibernation. It starts as a 2 a.m. revelation at night and develops into something that sounds like the kind of track you'd hear when you're alone at the small hours when your mind is racing too energetically. Constructed around an unstoppable acid bass line which pulsates like an unstoppable heartbeat that you can't switch off, the track moves with a loose but determined pace, combining hypnotic grooves with vocals that are otherworldly yet optimistic. There's a low-key intensity at play here, the kind of tension you find in early The Weeknd singles or James Blake's most emotionally vulnerable moments.<br><br>Leo XIV, the work of Dylan Leo Azadi, is a declaration of vulnerability unvarnished. There is no legend-building at work here, merely one individual piecing himself together from depression, addiction and anxiety with melody as sustenance. He is not attempting to sound like he's been attuned to the cosmos, he is attempting to remain upright. Feel syncs with instinct, it begins in the dark and travels towards something more like light. Attempt to see it as nesting between Frank Ocean's Blonde in its introspection and FKA twigs' pulse-drunk shadowdance. This is music for the ones who've put themselves on pause and are now restoring play even if their hands still tremble. With sophomore release Cold Open due in 2026, Leo XIV is less interested in show and more interested in emotional accuracy. Feel isn't a song, it's the sound of a person reminding themselves that they're still there.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4UhlD1GnhQmV8H5KbA3JHb?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Shervin Boloorian: A Voice Built for Quiet Revolutions</strong><br><br>My Free Heart, the new single from Iranian-born Bali-based musician and sound healer Shervin Boloorian, is the sort of song that doesn't compete for your attention, it settles in. His voice is positioned with a lived-in peace, as if defined by rest as much as action. He's not reaching for high drama or singles-list peak, but something more complex: peace that stays after the music ends. The English rendition carries a soft call, but the Persian rendition carries another level of emotional depth in putting the song in heritage and remembrance.<br><br>Boloorian's work has always broken the space between performance and healing space. His latest album I Hear You, Mother Earth won Global Peace Song Awards, and his Rumi-inspired album was blessed by Coleman Barks, a rare blessing from one who has experienced the power of words. But My Free Heart isn't religious drama. It's contemplative power in song, and it sounds less like a sweeping sermon and more like something you'd hear late in a movie from someone who sits alone in contemplation. If you enjoy the sensitivity of artists like José González or the calming rhythm of Trevor Hall, this song has the same feel.<br><br>Boloorian emerges from a location that does not seek the limelight but union. His international presence, from Balinese yoga rooms to off-the-radar performances overseas, has produced a sound that is never in haste. My Free Heart is a call to action to recall that tranquility can be paradoxical, particularly on a world that hardly pauses.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5KLX9LpyDgSphK7v0tM2uJ?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Deflecting Ghosts: Grit, Fury and the Will to Stand Up</strong><br><br>Risen by Kansas-based Deflecting Ghosts features a fist-in-a-clenched-fist vibe around melody. It is a song that is constructed on urgency, a swift punch at complacency with lyrics that question the world's current deterioration and not some obliquely suggestive of same. You can sense the strains of alternative metal and rock running through the track, the unvarnished intensity of Breaking Benjamin's early days, the purging grit of Nothing More, and an attitude for endurance drawn from decades of tough-won strife.<br><br>The band didn't begin inside a high-sheen studio with an entourage of executives dictating their sound. It began as Luke Fitzgerald's fiefdom, his own thing, when his old band broke up, and grew into full-blown force when Rhema became the bass player and Austin joined as drummer. That these are songs penned in the home studio gives them insurgent credibility, this is rebellion chronicled through actual walls and small rooms, not factory-raised angst.<br><br>Recorded and processed with varying degrees of success by New Years Day's Jeremy Valentyne and Brandon Wolfe, Risen becomes a compromise of heaviness and clarity, delivering each emotional blow with accuracy. Rhema's basslines reverberate with spirals of pain reserve and determination, and Austin's drumming is savage, as if hammered out to rid something from inside, rather than to awe. If rock in its best should be akin to mutual survival, this group rides hard for that conviction.<br><br>For the fans who were missing when rock music was still human and got beat up, imagine Chevelle introspection with the ferocity of pre-millen Thrice, Risen reminds that heavy can be kind.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/20jqFuoWxYySohcEP1kmOD?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Stray Planets: Pop Fractals and Psychedelic Echoes</strong><br><br>Are You Real, Cristobal Leedy? is not just an EP, it's experiencing a miniature cinema in someone's brain where every track warps the fabric of time. Dubliner John Butler, trading as Stray Planets, writes like he's splicing scenes of 60s psychedelia, shoegaze-washed dream sequences and latenight indie film together. The result is a five-track experience that feels both warped and strangely familiar, like an old record you’re sure you’ve heard before but can’t place.<br><br>Working once again with producer Rían Trench, Butler elevates his cult reputation with something deeply imaginative. Your Revolution opens with an era-bending shoegaze wash that questions whether machines will ever feel rebellion the way humans do. Hallucinations, with the lead vocals of Gilla Band's Dara Kiely, is like an AI breakdown viewed on a malfunctioning TV screen. Interlude Cristobal Leedy drifts on self-doubt, recalling that weird YouTube-comment experience where the person has a compliment for your work and you're left wondering if they even exist. Salvia twists through a Capel Street 3 a.m. fever dream. And Artificial Love ends in bittersweet glamour, questioning if synthetic affection is at times easier than actual connection.<br><br>Vinyl Williams, Jacco Gardner or the spaced-out goofiness of early Ariel Pink supporters will be equally entranced. Butler isn't guru or hero figure, just a guy in pursuit of sound that is half-forgotten, half-dreamed. This EP would be scored just as stunningly for an A24 film or some quirky special effects sci-fi love tale where love is a little too robotic and a little too material all at once.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6PDwiIKWQuF6OWatYcAS93?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Rose Ringed: Euphoria Written in Mourning</strong><br><br>Mylène, the first album by Amsterdam producer, drummer and jazz pianist Rose Ringed, is one of those albums defined by loss but filled with motion. A tribute to his mother, a jazz ballerina who died when he was 11, the album is both despair and illumination — grief turned into rhythm instead of stagnation. Where others would keep quiet in sorrow, Rose channelled catharsis through ecstatic electronic melody, building tracks that blaze and pulse with the resolve of one dancing through pain, not staying in it.<br><br>Rose Ringed's music is an emotional intensity mixed with dance-biability drawn from the freedom of trance and the block-by-block narrative of producers such as Bicep and Paul Kalkbrenner. It is not dance music per se, it is memory in arpeggio and chord progression listenable like latenight therapy sessions. You can sense the imprint of early reference points such as Enya and Hans Zimmer under the beat, which lends even the more forceful parts some gravity.<br><br>His path from drummer to jazz pianist to producer lends the music form and improvisational spirit. The fact that his ascension has reached as high as events such as Tomorrowland, Loveland and ADE only goes to show how this emotional authenticity speaks far and wide. Mylène is a man who senses he is finally hitting at the heart of what drives him, not ambition, but heritage.<br><br>Rose doesn't attempt to do tragedy. He's turning it into gasoline. It's the sort of record you play past midnight, when memory aches but the rhythm sweeps you along.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1KML3dPprByep3tRnYSJDj?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"align-center\"> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"> </p>",

Their sound crashes like a wrecking crew: guitars swinging frantically between chainsaw savagery and earworm hookiness, drums thundering maniacally over blackened skies, bass thudding like bones being rumbled beneath your feet, and vocals that kick their way right into the chest.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf43zldvxmE\" title=\"hellrazor - Sands Of Time\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>This is not gnat noise. This is honed pandemonium with hooks that cling long after the amps have been killed. HELLRAZOR takes an inspiration from the height of metal's hard-core roots, i.e., the raw power and boorish energy of early Priest or Metallica — but carries it forward to the modern era with the fire and attitude of modern rock and metalcore. You have fist-raising anthems designed for smoke-filled clubs, tattooed fists raised aloft, screams intended to be yelled by strangers who become gang members for a moment.<br><br>Their sound alternates between storm-bringer fury and unadulterated, over-the-top, cinematically-informed melodrama, in effect, a soundtrack to a motorbike gang arriving at the end of the world with lightning-filled skies and no plans on losing their momentum. There's intensity to the performance, but no slouching; the band is well aware of when to tighten the bolt and when to let the fury unleash.<br><br>That campy bite? That's vibe, that's not camp. Consider Ghost's horror-fixture showmanship meeting Avenged Sevenfold's punch-in-the-face brutality of early days. Riffs cut like a knife, choruses blaze like fire. No ballads. No filler. Just intent on steroids.<br><br>HELLRAZOR sounds like the live performance, sweat, strobes, boots thudding over monitors, and a front row full of screamin' fans yellin' out every lyric like they're livin' it. An unworried attitude is spreading throughout, the same one that evokes the hell-bent rebellion of classic metal without going so far as to retro.<br><br>This band is not faking it dressed up in costume as metal. They are metal,living it, bleeding it, and laying it down with enough power to incinerate a frozen town during a blackout. Plug the sound. Turn it up to eleven. If your heart fails to start pounding by the time the chorus kicks in, take your pulse — you may already be in the graveyard.<br><br>But fear not. HELLRAZOR seems to taunt that they are going to give you one last ride.</p>",

But when Kentucky bred shredder Mike Shouse finally emerged from hiding, he didn't reappear, he exploded. His new release, Jaded, released through Deko Entertainment, is a sonic boom re-entry that balances on the precipice between technical skill and emotional resonance. It's a living record, grounded in technique but entirely free, and inhabited by some of the most respected figures in guitar lore: Tony MacAlpine, Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, and Michael Angelo Batio.<br><br>Kentucky native, subsequently schooled at Hollywood's Guitar Institute of Technology, Shouse has been among the most innovative and skilled guitarists of his peer group for years. His previous albums, Enter the Soul (2001) and Alone on the Sun (2010), had also been praised for their unflinching combination of melody and precision, absolute proof that virtuosity and storytelling could go hand in hand. Jaded carries on that tradition, a purely instrumental album that is cinematic and intimate at the same time.<br><br>\"This album is a rebirth for me in many ways,\" Shouse says. There is a feeling of rebirth all the way through all the songs. You catch it in the mournful sting of Romeo Is Gone, the sweaty thrill of Let's Go, and the jaunty swagger of Smiley Faced Emoji. Even the final offering from the album, Upon Looking Back, carries the repressed assurance of an artist who has worked the highs and lows of artistic life and yet still blazes to perform.<br><br>Each visiting guitarist brings his own timbre to Shouse's compositions. Tony MacAlpine's smooth, classically aligned phrasing adds a sense of sophistication. Bumblefoot's erratically shifting tone, bristling with sharp edges and elasticity, sometimes hinting at the brink of mania, keeps the listener on edge. And Batio, the speed master of all time, brings blunt fire to the party, blasting the album's energy into orbit. But be warned: Jaded is Shouse's band from start to finish. The record sounds unified because his performance is the constant, melodic whenever it has to be, explosive whenever it needs to be, and expressive at all times.<br><br>The production, skillfully nurtured by Nashville's Billy Decker, provides the album with its glossy yet organic-sounding production. Drummer Charlie Zeleny (and collaborator with Jordan Rudess and Terry Bozzio) and Impellitteri bassist James Amelio Pulli complete the team, delivering the guitar fireworks with rhythmic weight. The result is an album that walks a fine line between technical proficiency and emotional expression, something that few instrumental albums achieve.<br><br>Hearing Jaded is somewhat akin to opening a time capsule from the height of the guitar hero days, the Surfing with the Alien and Passion and Warfare period, but it's not retro. Rather, it's respectful of that era's heritage and sounds totally of the moment. There's an undertone of sincerity that prevents it from becoming pastiche. Unlike some instrumental rock albums, which sound like showcases for technique, Shouse's playing is narrative, about loss and renewal and thanks.<br><br>Critics elsewhere in the world have already noticed. Iggy Magazine of France has labelled the album \"a fresco sound that is both technical and visceral.\" Music Review World has proclaimed it \"a technical wonder and an emotional journey.\" And Revista Sound Loop of Argentina has stated, \"Shouse triumphantly returns with an album that pushes the boundaries of the instrumental and sets a new benchmark for the genre.\" Such aren't empty encomiums. They’re recognition of an artist who has matured without losing his spark.<br><br>For those who live for the thrill of hearing a guitar really talk, Jaded is the reminder of what six strings can do in capable hands. Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Paul Gilbert enthusiasts will be home in a nanosecond, but Shouse's melodic, expressive playing carves out his own niche. The tune Bucket of Bolts (see it here<br>) is the perfect beginning point: all muscular and lighthearted, with a rhythm section enjoying themselves almost as much as the guitarist himself.<br><br>Jaded is not a comeback. It's a statement, that real musicianship does not die, that guitar instrumental rock can still thrill, and that sometimes laying it down is the way to come back more powerful. Shouse has forever been a master craftsman, but this record proves he's a writer, employing tone and phrasing to say what words cannot.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>F</strong><strong>ollow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Released March 14, 2025, the album is a testament to the band's DIY spirit as all ten tracks were composed, recorded, and produced in guitarist Dapé's home studio in Le Rove. The outcome is an album that contains raw energy combined with meticulous attention to detail, balancing retro nostalgia and new, forward-looking experimentation.<br><br>RedLight's sound genetic code is an intriguing blend. There are whispers of Pearl Jam's honest guitar-rock, The Beastie Boys' rhythmic experimentation, and The Cure's atmospheric soundscapes, all sounded over a base of dirty melodic sensibility. Homeworks takes its cue from that heritage but has no aspirations to stay there. The addition of Seb on drums adds a new, dynamic flavor to augment the seasoned rhythm section of Dapé, lead vocalist/guitarist Londres, and bassist Guy. The chemistry of the band is well-served here, each player contributing a distinct voice that fits beautifully into the overall sound.<br><br>Tracks such as forthcoming single Idea of Mine will be crowd-pleasers, their anthemic hooks and pounding beats, but it's the eclecticism of the album that most impresses. Some of the tracks descend into introspective, melodic vamps, others blow up with strobe-like hyperactivity redolent of the Strokes' earliest forms or the chant-along factor of the Pixies. RedLight's trick is in finding these poles—acoustic and scorching crescendos—and it's the secret to making Homeworks sound so wired and alive.<br><br>The DIY look of the album is not a mere exercise in image-making; it conditions the listener. There's the impression the band is in each moment of the production, making instinct-sounding decisions rather than ones that sound too polished. It's a way of thinking that brings to mind early Arctic Monkeys or even Beck, when personality and truth may come ahead of the gloss of the studio. Guitar-friendly alternative rock enthusiasts, from The Beatles' more experimental late-period output through the raw intensity of early 2000s garage rock, will find something to cling to here.<br><br>aside from the music, Homeworks is also a work of the new DIY production potential. With each step in the recording process handled in-house, RedLight show that rock music can still be successful away from big-label machinery, making music that is at once intimate and sweeping. On the record, you can feel the hours of refining texture, building up the melody, and grabbing at the moment of accident that gives the record its vitality.<br><br>RedLight have worked their way to respect by avoiding trends while being authentic. Homeworks does not tell listeners to be the same as the band—it opens its arms, providing something both old-school and spontaneous, intelligent and uncooked. It's testament that rock music is still capable of shocking, that DIY groups can still deliver fleshed-out albums without compromise, and that artistic freedom tends to leave the most engaging outcomes.<br><br>For enthusiasts in search of an ear trip that respects the past but engages with the promise of DIY recording, Homeworks is a joyous celebration. RedLight continue to demonstrate that Marseille can produce rock with heart, attitude, and a very distinctive twist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>F</strong><strong>ollow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Released on October 3, 2025, the album is a carefully curated 18-song collection, each song selected by the listeners themselves. It's an odd choice in a music industry that's artist- or label-driven, and it speaks to Barlow wanting to create music that will resonate as completely with other people as it does with him.<br><br>Throughout the course of the first song, By Special Request makes its stand. Barlow floats between bluesy, introspective tunes along the lines of Emotional Journey and harder, grittier material from The Bill Barlow Project. The result is an album that glides seamlessly back and forth between introspective sentiment and acid, dry narrative. Critics have long praised Barlow's facility for conveying raw emotion, and here it's in high relief. Laugh-out-loud moments come all too quickly often followed by squirming ones, a discomfort Barlow evades with ease, a demonstration of his carefully honed lyricism.<br><br>Tunes such as \"When He Speaks,\" which previously reached 41 on the Euro Indy Artist radio charts, show Barlow's ability to turn life observations into solid stories. Album sequencing, it seems, is intentional, as each track smoothly links to the next, creating a continuity of humor, sarcasm, and emotional honesty. Listeners who appreciate Barlow's music will recognize his characteristic observational style, but the album also presents new textures and dynamics that support the richness of his songwriting as well as empathy for human emotion.<br><br>By Special Request sits well alongside other fan-favorite or thematically sequential albums that encourage listener involvement, evoking efforts like Taylor Swift's Folklore and Evermore, which marry confessional storytelling with a unifying, cinematic atmosphere. By the same token, the pairing of witty, readable lyrics and musical variety places Barlow in league with artists such as Leon Bridges or Allen Stone, whose music is equal parts soulful rhythm and openness. For anyone looking to hear music that's both intelligent and emotional, Barlow's new album is full of both.<br><br>Outside the studio, Barlow has fostered an active online presence, communicating directly with fans on media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube. His on-line work, usually presented in the guise of behind-the-scenes looks at his songwriting, serves to reinforce the intimacy and immediacy that characterize By Special Request. This artist-fan relationship carries over from the music into the act of listening, encouraging listeners to feel personally responsible for every note and line.<br><br>In the end, By Special Request is more than a favorites album. It's an offer to listen for a dialogue between artist and listener, to locate the humor, openness, and observational acuity that have characterized Bill Barlow's life's work. With its mix of blues, R&amp;B, and hard-telling songcraft, the album is a testament to the emotional strength of music that listens as much as it talks.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Born in Hong Kong, raised in San Francisco, educated in Britain, the artist has never regarded music as mere sound—it's world-building. Her songs sit in the crossroads of a movie soundtrack and dance floor, where global beats and classical orchestration mingle with narrative emotion. Now, with her latest release Labyrinth Of Life (Eddie Craig Remix) releasing October 25 on On QiiA Media, Qymira reimagines power, vulnerability, and cinematic scale for the fourth time.<br><br>The song is one of a string of chart-topping hits from the artist, such as Wait For No One, Give It To Me, and Brazilian hit radio favorites Perdão, Sun &amp; Sea, and Vem Comigo. But Labyrinth Of Life is different. It's heavier, darker, and more introspective—less about escaping, more about confronting what's beneath the surface. The track joins Qymira's authoritative vocals with snappy production from Eddie Craig—he's half of UK electronic duo The Wideboys, who've produced for Rihanna, Kylie Minogue, and Girls Aloud. Add in a verse by ItzDvn, whose delivery brings the grit to this song, and you've got something that is simultaneously spiritual and physical, mental and club-danceable.<br><br>Labyrinth Of Life is a thematically deconstructionist song. It's an invitation to wake up—to draw back the curtain on all that is artificial, surface-level, performative. Qymira describes it as \"a search for truth and clarity through a labyrinth of distractions.\" But this is not sanctimonious cogitating; this is an anthem that succeeds. The orchestral arrangement, composed and arranged by Qymira herself with the assistance of the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra, raises a dance track to something exalted. It's Inception and The Matrix in their heads if they were being sound-tracked for an electronic opera. You can picture this track ending an episode of Euphoria or thumping through a late-night Drive montage—neon glows on wet pavement, all a little dreamlike but very real.<br><br>This drop follows hard on the heels of Melodrama (RainForest Edit), another with Eddie Craig that took her first orchestral single and remixed it as an ecstasy dance edit. It pared the sound back to staccato synths and rhythmic chunk but retained Qymira's magnetic vocals at the forefront. That track was one about illusion and manipulation—dynamics of power that distort relationships. Labyrinth Of Life blows open that world, takes individualized chaos and universalizes it. It's not one relationship now; it's systems we inhabit and the identities we construct within them.<br><br>Qymira's ascent has been anything but conventional. Classically trained on violin, piano, and voice since childhood, she was already leading orchestras as a teenager. Her debut single Satisfied made No. 1 in the UK Music Week Breakers Chart and propelled her onto a UK tour that saw her performing in front of tens of thousands. She has since conducted members of premier orchestras throughout Asia and had her music performed on the world's stages. The music she is making today—this union of classical grandeur, global beat, and electronic bite—sounds like the natural extension of that tradition.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

The song dropped on September 26, 2025, and it marks a positive step in Benjamin's musical growth, with a demonstration of his capacity to balance sophisticated instrumentation with lyrical storytelling.<br><br>From the first few seconds, Pyromane crafts a rich setting, one of heat, urgency, and closeness mingling together. The drums are alive with the feel of a festival, while the strings introduce an almost motion picture elegance, surrounding Benjamin's voice in a manner that is rough and yet otherworldly. It's a sonic tapestry that evokes visions of a gypsy entertainer near a roaring fire, hot and inescapable but cultured and controlled. The skillful weaving of language and rhythm in the song illustrate Benjamin's aptitude both as storyteller and musician, mediating tale and tone. <br><br>Pyromane, musically, probe the constants of humanity, desire, and longing. Benjamin portrays love not as romance itself, but as something natural, unpredictable, devouring, and intensely beautiful. The understated dance of percussion, clapping, and castanets at the end of the song leaves the listener suspended in that place between fantasy and reality, where the music is the vehicle for feeling. The song structure, although based on the traditional samba beats, is completely modern, so it is perfectly suited to fit any level of intimacy listening, as well as larger playlists of world, inflected pop or indie songs.<br><br>Benjamin Quartz' innovation in this case is reminiscent of lush experimentation in the style of Devendra Banhart or Rodrigo Amarante but infused with his own unique French sensibility. There's an eternal quality to his work: you're in a Parisian café at night, in a Brazilian square during sunset, and in a candlelit, intimate setting simultaneously. It's this cross, cultural sensitivity and emotional intelligence that makes Pyromane so fascinating.<br><br>For those who listen to rich-textured, world-infused music, Pyromane sits comfortably alongside new music by cutting-edge world, pop acts such as Ibeyi, Aurora, or even more rhythmically adventurous songs by Carla Morrison. Its film and dance suitability would not only go well with sensual or narrative-heavy films but could equally be likened to the soundtracks of Call Me by Your Name or The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.<br><br>In an oft-too-formula-filled musical landscape, Benjamin Quartz reminds us that passion and grace can be balanced, that poetry and rhythm can collide without sacrificing their finesse. Pyromane is a song; it's a brief, transporting excursion to a world where music writes in a way words cannot. By the time the last castanet fades, you’re left not just with a melody, but with a sense of place, mood, and longing, a testament to Benjamin Quartz’s growing mastery of his craft.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Reborn isn't. It's the product of years of acquiring knowledge, listening, and suffering. On twenty-four tracks, Amara Fe digs deep into a reservoir of family myth, musical heritage, and plain determination. It's not an album — it's an assembly of soul, rhythm, and resolve.<br><br>Out on September 9, 2025, Reborn is ambitiously expansive for a debut from an artist not willing to play it small. Most debuts are tentative-sounding six-songs-and-a-hopeful-prayer-for-playlist-ness exercises, but Amara bursts in with an album twice the size, just as varied, and utterly unique. It's the sound of an artist determined not to hold back, and you can hear that dedication in every lyric, every hook, every hit of every beat.<br><br>Raised in Mission, USA, Amara Fe has more than love for music — she has roots. Her roots started long before a studio mic ever recorded her voice. There's her uncle Eugene and Rene, whose day-long-long Tulsa, Oklahoma, jam sessions of yesteryear used to keep her up, and her grandmother, who had written for the great Minnie Riperton. All of them are embedded in Reborn. You hear them in the heat of the chords and the authenticity of her lyrics, as if specters of vintage tunes cooed along with her.<br><br>The heartbeat of the album is its eclecticism. \"It's made for every ear,\" Amara assures, and she is on the money. Reborn glides from genre to genre effortlessly — soul ballads sounding like pre-dawn after heartbreak, pop songs romping together with funk, R&amp;B grooves sprinkled with introspection. It's not often that an artist manages variety work at the expense of cohesion, but Amara weaves it all together in her voice, shifting from smooth restraint to raw intensity with seamless ease. She's whispering in your ear one second, soaring over piled harmonies that sound like gospel translated in today's pop the next.<br><br>There is something movie-like to Reborn. It might take a season of your life — all-night rides, wake-up calls, the silence following big choices. You can envision it alongside albums like Alicia Keys' The Diary of Alicia Keys, H.E.R.'s eponymous release, or even Lana Del Rey's Norman Fing Rockwell!*** in its balance of soul and narrative. All the tracks are inhabited, not written for trends or for hits but born of somewhere true.<br><br>The album title aptly reflects this. Reborn is what it's like when an artist becomes overwhelmed in the moment —recycling scraps of her former self and remaking them over again. That taking back is only half of what makes it so strong. Whatever she sings about self-esteem, love, or believing, there's always some undertow of persistence that keeps everything glued together. You can tell these songs were constructed laboriously, brick by brick on a canvas.<br><br>Amara's voice has the kind of emotional gravity that doesn't require amplifying. She isn't over-singing or relying on studio gimmicks. Her tone is carrying the load — the kind of voice that'll sound best via a good pair of headphones or in a dark room with the volume cranked just past comfortable. Imagine the intimacy of Sade or the subtle strength of Solange, but channeled through Amara's own light.<br><br>What Reborn has that is great is also its restraint. Amidst the culture of music so fixated on singles, Amara's twenty-four-track first album comes close to being inflammatory. It encourages you to let it live with you, allow the songs to unspool. It's an album that believes in albums — a complete thing, not a scroll. And that belief makes it even more rewarding.<br><br>Her production decisions mirror that same faith. The productions strike a balance between new-school texture and old-school soul components — live bass lines, fiery keys, and vocal stacks that reference Motown but feel now. It's something that would reside comfortably on a playlist with Jazmine Sullivan, Anderson .Paak, and Erykah Badu, but one distinguished by Amara's unmistakable world — intimate, sensual, and heavy with nostalgia.<br><br>If Reborn were a film, it would be Selma encountering A Star Is Born: one historically, the other unapologetically in self-exploration. It is that artful blend of respect and disobedience.<br><br>You sense this album was labored slow — not merely to write, but to breathe. It's from a person with enough life to know music isn't flawless, it's conversational. Each song sounds like a letter to somebody, or perhaps to herself. And among the two dozen tracks, you get the impression that Amara Fe isn't in town to make a statement. She's just letting us know what she knows — and there's a lot of that.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Her latest single Gold Rush (released September 26) is off to a flying start with infectious energy, rich storytelling, and hooky combinations of indie pop, rock, and cinematic-like sophistication. Recording and produced by Kim Wennerström, the track is the last teaser before Fusaro's long-awaited sophomore album Looking for Connection releases on October 24 — and by all accounts, including Gold Rush, one of the most urgent pop records of the year.<br><br>Gold Rush strikes us immediately upon first listen like a runaway anthem. Its beat pounds hard, the type that makes you go before your head catches on. But under the gloss, it is all about the anxiety — the desiring, the seeking, the contemporary hunger for more. Fusaro digs into the legend of California's Gold Rush in converting a 19th-century tale of greed and aspiration into a commentary on our time. She gazes upon fevered quest for validation, sleepless desire to \"win big,\" and the quiet loneliness that usually follows. \"Everybody wants to be successful, rich, have it all — and in a hurry,\" Fusaro states. \"Gold Rush is about that high and the price of wanting more.\"<br><br>That cost goes deep. It begins with the Italian words \"Dai tira il dado dai\" (\"Roll the dice, come on\"), a brazen invitation to take the risk. Then all the machinery is engaged — glinting synths, pounding bassline, and a screaming vocal that builds up until it is almost explosive. When Fusaro sings “Fast life, I’m living the fast life”, she captures both the thrill and unraveling of ambition, a feeling that hits somewhere between euphoria and exhaustion. It’s the same emotional territory that artists like HAIM, Maggie Rogers, and The Killers often explore: the intoxicating side of ambition, and what happens when the high fades.<br><br>The track precedes Jealousy and No Rain No Tears, the highlight tracks which provided an appetizer of the sonic range of Looking for Connection. While those initial releases tipped the nod towards rhythm and love introspection, Gold Rush is the spark — forceful, insistent, and cinematic. It's an open-road-at-night-city-lights song, the sort that makes you recall the mind-blinkingly false promise of success that characterizes so much of contemporary life. You can easily envision it over a shot in Babylon or Euphoria, where burnout and beauty coincide in the same shot.<br><br>Fusaro's voice has always functioned by balancing precariously on that tightrope between light and darkness. Her 2023 release All the Colors of the Sky led No. 5 on the Swiss charts, an ethereal collection of tunes that established her as both delicate and bold. She's gone on to perform more than 500 concerts in Europe, the UK, and elsewhere — including at Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz Festival, and a sold-out headlining performance at Kaufleuten in Zurich. Being on stage with Mark Knopfler at the Amphitheater in Nîmes only demonstrated her capability to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the legends.<br><br>It's not so much her singing voice — which slides from sultry stillness to full-throated emotion — but the way she crafts sentences. Fusaro's lyrics cut without irony, with unvarnished candor and melody. To that degree, she reminds us of Taylor Swift's 1989-period confessional directness, the movie-studio gloss of Lana Del Rey, and the earthy confessionalism of Clairo. But the actual songs she writes are unique: light but textured, intimate but scratchy.<br><br>Searching for Connection is her most intimate work yet, an album that arose from a paradox — more connected than ever before, but lonelier each day. Through its lyrics, she is looking at ambition (Gold Rush), rivalry (Jealousy), and heartbreak (No Rain No Tears) and the incessant din of contemporary living (Slot Machine). It’s a record about the distance between who we are and who we pretend to be — and the fragile hope that maybe, somewhere in between, real connection still exists.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",
