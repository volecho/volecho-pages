            "content_html": "<p>Makanduk, the Sydney-born self-taught producer, is a standout talent who makes a laptop and bits of gear bigger than the room it sprang from. His new EP, Ruined, released October 10, 2025, is a trim, driving declaration that weaves club sound with sci-fi texture and the desolate feeling of a middle-of-the-night drive along a city that doesn't even exist.<br><br>Makanduk's sound exists in just the right spot between beat and atmosphere. He's plainly borrowed from producers like Chris Lake and Chris Stussy, but where his sound succeeds is in its sense of film. There's groove, there's sweat, but there's story too. The three songs that constitute Ruined—specifically the trance-nation Crazy and low-slung bruiser Reason—sound like scenes in a hitech-colored film, half action and half suspense. You can almost envision the strobe light and fog machines, that sort of fog where time crawls just so the drop strikes all the more forcefully.<br><br>Where the production is sleek and about to drop at the club, there is something beating like nostalgia coursing through it. Makanduk resides in between Sydney and Germany, and that bite of cultural duality creeps in big and small ways. There's the precision and order of Berlin electronic music and the open-road, sun-kissed sound of Sydney. It pops up in transitions, where minimalist cool clashes with warm melody, or how he allows basslines to wander like characters and not rhythms.<br><br>What's admirable about Ruined is how well it works considering that it was born in a home studio. There's no feeling of being restrained here. Rather, the lo-fi equipment lends the EP its edge, a raw intensity that sheen production compromises. Each hi-hat crack is sharp, each build measured. It's the sound of an artist who learned that emotion is greater than gear.<br><br>Tracks like Crazy are set for underground club dance floors but also sustain themselves during a night-walk listened to through the headphones. It's a balancing act difficult to achieve—club music that can also be a solo activity. You hear it on albums like Fred again.'s Actual Life, or in the dramatic tension of Trentemøller's The Last Resort. There's intensity, but there's also considered thought. A physical and affective groove.<br><br>Reason, another jewel, is heavier with a gritty bass line that pretty much demands a bass face. It's a testament to Makanduk being no mere coloring with atmosphere but building tension and release in good faith. There's a hint of that early 2010s vibe—think Deadmau5 or Eric Prydz—refracted through a contemporary lens, cut to the bone and fueled by feel.<br><br>You can tell that Ruined is more than a name—it's a theme. The songs sound like the soundtrack to burning to the ground in progress, to elegance in things deteriorating over time. It's dance music that seeks to capture the ridiculousness of seeing a city burn in the club. Destructive, but cleansing. Like sweating out tears of sorrow in strobing lights.<br><br>It's refreshing to see a producer getting enthusiastic about fantasy in a scene which often fetishizes over templates and trends. Makanduk talks about writing his music as he would write \"sci-fi and action movie scenarios,\" and that's precisely how it sounds. You can put these tracks into something like Blade Runner 2049 or Drive and they'd fit right in. They have that mix of pulse and emotion, the feeling that something’s about to happen.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "summary": "While playlists reign and albums increasingly are heard these days in snippets,&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">While playlists reign and albums increasingly are heard these days in snippets, Bright Shining Lights have done the opposite. Their sophomore full-length album, The Sun Is A Star, is not an assembly of songs. It's an aural-image trip of music and narrative, a concept album that is like listening to a movie. Dropped solo on DistroKid this September, the record is an ode to a time when listeners stayed put, let the lights grow low, and let the music take hold.<br><br>Art C. Gusmano and Rob Maru, the two men behind the project, have a background. Both were members of 90s New Jersey group Wellcurbs, a local legend for their misty mix of guitar-scorched despair and melodic sensibility. Having spent years writing in solitude, the duo came together as Bright Shining Lights and dropped their own debut, This Is Where We Start, in 2020 on Deko Entertainment. That drop foreshadowed the widescreen scope that will characterize The Sun Is A Star—but not this time, they left nothing in their back pocket.<br><br>Listening to The Sun Is A Star is like stepping into a world of its own. The album begins with \"Go For Launch,\" a thudding, ambient song that might soundtrack the beginning of a great science fiction epic. The album then unspools across sixteen tracks that chart both a literal and figurative route: discovery, loneliness, community, purpose. It's music constructed from human queries, in starry terms. Gusmano and Maru do not use space as a place of fantasy, but as a reflection of what it is to be alive and looking.<br><br>\"Everything started with a single song, actually,\" Gusmano said of Go For Launch. \"It was the foundation for all the rest of it. Space is a good place to start because it's all about the unknown. From there, we wanted to see if we could take all these ideas of isolation, and purpose, and having to belong to something greater than yourself.\" <br><br>There's a build-creep sense to the sequencing of the album. Early tracks glow with energy and propulsion, and subsequent tracks lean towards introspection and emotional depth. There is a point at which the guitars sound like they might have emanated from Dark Side of the Moon, then another in which they evoke the ghostly sadness of OK Computer. There are echoes of The Cure's retro design and Arcade Fire's sweep and grandeur, but there isn't anything that feels like copying. The group proudly flaunts their influences but uses them as points of departure of orbit rather than anchors.<br><br>The music is lush and cinematic. Synths ascend like solar gusts, drums drop with carved heat, and vocals drift on a plane of confession and incantation. The songs are easy to envision as part of a film's soundtrack, which is no accident. The inspiration of cinema drives how the duo composes music. They're not creating singles for instant listen—they're composing music for the score of a non-existent film. The listener is the protagonist.<br><br>Maru views the scope of the project with the kind of exhaustion that only occurs after decades of building. \"These types of projects take time,\" he said. \"You work on version after version until words and sound finally come together and form something that is meaningful. You can't speed it up. You just have to be in it.\"<br><br>And that is what distinguishes The Sun Is A Star. They are inviting you to slow down. When musicians today struggle to compromise 15 seconds of someone's attention, Gusmano and Maru struggle for an hour and half—and and they're worth every moment of it. The album is like an artifact from the past, when listeners wore out CD booklets and stayed up nights deciphering lyrics.<br><br>Fans of M83’s Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming, The War on Drugs’ Lost in the Dream, or even Interstellar’s score by Hans Zimmer will find plenty to love here. It’s a record that rewards immersion, best played from start to finish with the lights down and maybe a little stargazing out the window.<br><br>There's also a thematic affinity between films such as Solaris or Ad Astra—films which take the chill of space to stretch towards human feeling. As with those films, The Sun Is A Star isn't concerned with flight; it's concerned with looking in. Each synth wave, each reverb-drenched chord, sounds like a hushed conversation between what's out there and what's in here.<br><br>The chemistry of Gusmano and Maru is what holds the album together. They share the history that reflects how the songs breathe. They play like old friends finishing each other's sentences, or movie directors knowing precisely when to hold the camera and when to cut.<br><br>The Sun Is A Star isn't easily slotted into the stream culture of today, but that's exactly the point. It's in the same tradition as Pink Floyd's The Wall or Radiohead's Kid A—albuns that demand work and faith, that reward those who persevere. It's a work of some kind of modest bravery, the sort that doesn't seek permission and pursue a trend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

They possess that combination of hope, fear, and hunger that can't be faked. Eterna, the debut album by Vanessa Marie King, not only does that description justice—it embodies it. From Mission, Washington, and on the family-owned label KINGBYDESIGN, Vanessa's debut full-length album sounds like it was recorded in the wee hours, after midnight, when every note matters and time isn't wasted. It's gentle, consistent, and packed with little details that linger long after the last track.<br><br>The album dropped on September 30, 2025, but already feels like an instant classic. There is no flash for sale here, no false exercise in seducing the trends. Rather, Eterna teases in the space between memory and confession, a rebuke of songs derived from a kind of emotional truth that just isn't good enough on the contemporary production line. The title track sets the tone—soft but uncompromising, ethereal but real. It is the sound of a person who has discovered the price of vulnerability and yet continues to sing.<br><br>Vanessa does not sing these songs but lives in them. In \"Jugaste con fuego,\" she is the fire and its smolder, the rage and the breath. Production is taut but not aseptic, her voice provided room to unfurl and the rhythms to anchor. There is a heartbeat underlying—Latin beats wedded to pop structures, rolled guitars sweeping over vacant beats. \"Niña perdida,\" perhaps the album's emotional center, shifts gears; it's slower, quieter, as if conversing with an older version of oneself. It's the type of song that the listener is left with in order to find their own connection, to recall their own tragedy.<br><br>Most interesting about Eterna is how Vanessa remains on that edge of control and intimacy. You sense her self-control in the words, the restraint in the delivery. She's not demonstrating that she can sing, she's demonstrating that she can feel. What she is able to extract is something alive, and completely possessed. There are traces of young Natalia Lafourcade in the sweetness, some of Carla Morrison's sadness, and even the grunge of Rosalía pre-fame when her music was edgier. But Vanessa never receives the sense that she is in someone else's debt. She constructs her own landscape from common earth.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><br><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wubaVcGQwIQ?list=OLAK5uy_n-5emWw_SmMsU3mSLslsL2d9ZbWB8vPD0\" title=\"Estoy tan orgullosa de ti\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>There is something filmic about the pacing of the album too. Hearing Eterna in its entirety is akin to viewing a movie that does not require a turn in the plot to sustain your interest. It's the mood it evokes, the manner in which a subtle melodic adjustment is able to propel an entire scene from hopelessness to healing without ever altering a lyric. You might envision these tunes accompanying some A24-type coming-of-age feature about adolescence along the border, or a laid-back indie feature in which little happens but all that does is significant. Consider how Normal People employed music to sustain mood, or how Call Me By Your Name built silences into narrative. Eterna has that kind of emotional pacing, too: low-key but charged. <br><br>Production-wise, KINGBYDESIGN tightens the album up and brings it close. There's earthiness that implies home-made material perhaps late nights in a tiny studio, where the sound man has an idea when to hold back and buff and let the idiosyncrasies breathe. You can bet Vanessa has played a part in cutting each nuance. The drums are natural, the guitars are human, and the synths hover like footnotes and not headlines. It's an album that is aware that sometimes the softest noise is the heaviest.</p>\n<p>The greatest thing about Vanessa Marie King is she's not trying to invent the wheel. She's attempting to be real. Eterna isn't seeking to make big declarations about the world—it's mapping the emotional fingerprints of an individual attempting to make sense out of love and loss. That level of intensity does not exist. In a world where artists so often sacrifice sincerity for spectacle, Vanessa does the opposite, wagering on low-key conviction.<br><br>If you're the sort of listener who craves recordings that seem to have a handmade texture, this one's for you. Julieta Venegas or even Billie Eilish's more introspective songs have listeners who'll hear something familiar here—a balance of intimacy and production sheen that never tips over into excess. You might also situate Eterna in the company of records like Arca's La Maravilla for emotional bravery, or Valeria Castro's Cuídate for whispered-over heartbreak.<br><br>There's a thread that runs through all of these records: music as mirror, not mask. Lisa succeeds easily in that tradition. Her lyrics are real-worn, her melodies heavy with the weight of age. When she sings about being strong, it's not of the inspirational kind—it's living, the quiet determination of rising up time when time will not. That's the vitality that keeps Eterna going, the feeling that every song is an act of small being alive.<br><br>Aside from the music, what is thrilling is what Eterna means to her future. It is neither so much a debut nor a status that emotional depth can dominate in an overcrowded world. There is no gimmickry, no ironic distance, no viral hook for a brief fifteen seconds of fame. Rather, Vanessa provides us the old-fashioned one that is still best of all: honesty.<br><br>If you've got Eterna on in the background, it'll be nice. But if you listen to it with headphones, late at night, you'll find that it's doing something quietly other. It's reminding you of the little private truths that are just below the surface of the day—the kind that don't go away even when the music goes away.<br><br>In the end, Vanessa Marie King doesn't so much make an album, she makes a place to think. Eterna is not in grand gestures or glimmery production tricks. It's in the boil of emotion, the quiet-still repairing that happens when something breaks. It's the kind of album that probably will be more meaningful the second time you hear it, then again in a year.<br><br>So listen to it on a road trip or at the stroke of midnight one Sunday morning when you're analyzing everything too much. Listen to it alongside a viewing of Her or Aftersun—movies that realize that quiet can say it all. And when you reach the end of the last song, don't skip ahead. Be still with it. Let it buzz on the horizon. Because Eterna is not asking you to go anywhere. It only wants to remind you how to get home.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Not the brazen, viral, blink, and, you, miss, it sort of fame, but the persistent, unavoidable presence of an artist whose imprimatur is on every note of a generation. That is the kind of legacy Audius has, a name that is not yelled out from all platforms, but one that lingers behind the loudest voices in Australian music today.<br><br>For over two decades, Audius Mtawarira has been a wellspring of innovation that transcended continents, styles, and generations. Born on the continent, residing in Australia, he's spent over two decades building the nation's musical geography from the ground up. His discography comprises pop, R&amp;B, urban, and everything in between from glossy commercial hits to richly textured AfroHouse sagas. In an industry that has a penchant for launching forward at warp speed, Audius not only kept pace, but remained abreast, riding each wave without sacrificing his sense of art.<br><br>He's been the unseen hand behind the breakthroughs of scores of artists, the uncredited hand of the tunes that created them their first moment of real recognition, since the early 2000s. His earlier work helped launch household names like Delta Goodrem and Jessica Mauboy, artists who would go on to define Australian pop for decades to come. Working with international artists like Flo Rida, Rahsaan Patterson, Iyaz, and DJ Fresh, Audius has built himself a reputation as one of the people who can get something real out of each artist he works with. It is not about commanding a sound so much as bringing something out.<br><br>What distinguishes him is not simply the hits, there are plenty of them, over 8 million units sold and 20 million streams overseas, it's that he's committed to development. In an era of fast, turnaround singles and TikTok stardom, Audius is persisting with slow build: collaborating with artists in an attempt to discover their voice prior to the world knowing. His studio is not just a work room; it is an identity workshop, where young artists discover how to take emotion and make it melody, and experience and make it story.<br><br>His range as a producer is staggering. One day he’s sculpting rich, percussive AfroHouse tracks that pulse with ancestral rhythm, the next he’s writing glossy, radio, ready hooks that could soundtrack a summer. Listen to the thread that runs through all of it, though, and you’ll find the same thing: impeccable vocals, precise emotional control, and a deep understanding of what makes music move people.<br><br>If you listen hard, you can hear echoes of his presence in artists who now dictate the rhythm of Australian pop culture. There's that fluid blend of R&amp;B sensuality and melodic swagger that seems to run through the country's biggest exports. Picture early Mauboy, picture Ricki, Lee Coulter, picture the smooth, but, earthy production sheen that defined a decade of radio pop. That sound didn't just happen. Someone had to shape it, and that someone was most likely Audius.<br><br>There’s also a cinematic quality to his recent work, especially his forays into AfroHouse and Amapiano. Those tracks carry the warmth and rhythm of his roots, blending the communal spirit of African music with the slick polish of modern production. It’s the kind of sound you’d expect to hear bleeding out of a club in Johannesburg just as easily as a festival in Sydney, a truly global groove that refuses to be pinned down.<br><br>It's easy enough to couple Audius with other behind, the, scenes giants, the Max Martins or Pharrell Williams sort, but his own career has another flavor. It's half cultural interpretation and half pop perfection. He's a connector between scenes, continents, art and business. That makes him replaceable.<br><br>As Australian music continues to get larger globally, Audius has a reminder that good pop is not made by algorithms or by formulas. It's made by connection, by someone who understands both the artist and the listener. He's been the middleman for over two decades, and judging by the look of the next generation of stars in his charge, he has no plans of letting up.<br><br>If comparisons are to be made, think along the lines of producers like Mark Ronson in soul mode, or the cross-genre mastery of Timbaland at his peak. Still, Audius remains very much his own man. He's built a career on imitation without disappearing, guidance without overshadowing, and always keeping the music above all else.<br><br>The irony of his own name is not lost, Audius, the man whose music you've heard more times than you most likely ever realize. He may not be in the mood for the spotlight, but the artists he's shaped, the music he's refined, and the songs he's helped bring into being speak a story that is very apparent: the Australian music industry wouldnt quite be the same without him.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Their sophomore album, Oscar Bravo Juliett, is out October 17, 2025, as the frenetic peak of the ambitious NATO Call Sign Trilogy, sandwiched between Whiskey Hotel Tango (2023) and Romeo Bravo Bravo Tango (2024). Dark, cinematic rock in nine songs is designed to translate the live freneticness and shadowy menace fans have come to anticipate, a set of songs that sound like surreptitious instructions passed back and forth across lines of fire. Frank Rabbitte, The Architect, and River Rabbitte, The Femme Fatale, have co-written a deadly soul Ã¢â‚¬â€œ noir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ infused rock sound. It's eroticism and garage sleaze blended, created for closing time and second chance. Oscar Bravo Juliett hears the pair further refining their characteristic tension, balancing weight and fragility, as River's assertive vocals slice through Frank's crunchy, blues-infused guitar riffs. The outcome is an album that is cinematic yet also intimate, the sense that each song is a vignette from some dismal city tale that is both personal and charged.<br><br>The album is also a tease for a second record, out single, Monsters of Nothing (The FURY Edition), a song with Chicago rapper FURY. The individual couple River pairs femme fatale firepower with razor, sharp hip, hop, crashing the duo's noir sense of style into rock, rap that propels their story world into new and uncharted dimensions. For listeners, it's a promise that wht.rbbt.obj won't remain confined to genre lines; their aesthetic resonates in tension, in uncertainty, and narrative depth.<br><br>Their live lives attest to this reputation. The pair, supported by a touring band, have tore through SXSW, Summerfest, and Riot Fest stages, sponsored events, with drenched-with-sweat, high, sweat-drenched, energy shows that sound as loose as they are tight. Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Nashville have all received their blues-inflected garage rock and soul plugged into urgent and style. Rolling Stone admired them with their \"velvet tones and late, night decadence,\" and NPR's Sound Opinions called them \"heavily distorted roadhouse raunch.\" This citation illustrates the duo's skill at crafting music that is raw but captivating, a contemporary renaissance of rock's danger and sexiness.<br><br>Oscar Bravo Juliett will appeal to The Kills, The Dead Weather, and bands who invoke grit with glamour fans. Movie fans who love rock stories, such as the noir-soaked swagger of Drive's score or the smoke-suffused smolder of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, will be transported to wht.rbbt.obj's world. Their EP releases Whiskey Hotel Tango and Romeo Bravo Bravo Tango demonstrated them capable of crafting narrative via audio tension, and this third installment threatens the complete cycle, tension, yearning, and cathartic payoff bound in black, throbbing rock rhythms.<br><br>Wht.rbbt.obj excel by their subtle blending of narrative, texture, and urgency. Frank's guitar and production providing the songs' roots in blues, dirty grime, and River's vocals imbuing them with a femme fatale seductiveness, exposed and authoritative. The songs are shaped with the DIY anger of a seasoned band, from cramped basement practice rooms to summertime festival headlining stages, without sacrificing the close-up danger and security that renders their songs so appealing.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

A founding member of the much-loved Cisco, MacLeod helped shape a distinctly Irish flavor of jangly, melodic pop that blended the sincerity of folk with the confidence of classic rock. And now, with his latest single Cool Charisma out in October 2025, he shows his skill at writing classic pop hooks hasn't faded whatsoever.<br><br>Cool Charisma perches on a sheeny wave of glistening guitar hooks and hookiness that lodges in the brain, the type of tune that should be background to some late-summer montage — windows rolled down, city lights whizzing past, and a tune that wouldn't quit your head. Sheeny indie pop with substance, constructed from a bouncy call-and-response hook that's a serotonin fix for anybody who loves melody-apologetic songwriting.<br><br>There's something inherently timeless to MacLeod's music, but not retro or nostalgic. His music touches the core of the legends — The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Motown — but interprets them with a contemporary sensibility that's intelligent rather than derivative. He swaddles warmth and wit in his words, layering hope with questions regarding meaning and identity. The melodies bring you in; the lyrics keep you there.<br><br>MacLeod's background informs his work. As a hub figure for Cisco, he cut with U2's former producer Paul Barrett and saw the band achieve local success and international acclaim with their album No. 1. Although Cisco eventually went under, MacLeod continued on his own, cutting multiple solo albums and developing his sound into something highly personal. With each release, his next moved further into revealing yet another aspect of his musical expertise — half classicist, half experimenter, half philosopher.<br><br>If you listen to Cool Charisma, you can sense the layers peeling away in the moment. Under its glossy exterior lies something reflective, nearly otherworldly, as if MacLeod is posing questions about what charm is, precisely, in an age of image and diversion. The groove is catchy, but there's always something more simmering beneath the surface — a rhythm that has become the signature of his songcraft.<br><br>It's easy to envision Cool Charisma cozied up in the same batch as acts like Crowded House, The Shins, or Belle and Sebastian — music that loves melody and message together. There's something in there too that's reminiscent of retro movie energy, something that would slide readily into a coming-of-age film or a bittersweet romantic comedy. Imagine High Fidelity but in contemporary Dublin, or the golden-painted optimism of Almost Famous reproduced under Irish skies.<br><br>And there is more to come. MacLeod will be putting out New Start in Spring 2025 — an innovative era-mapping album — and the experimental piece We Don't See What That We Don't See, which demonstrates his continued curiosity and reluctance to stay in one groove of genre. That ability to challenge himself, to balance pop urgency with more considered deliberation, is part of the reason that his work is so compelling.<br><br>Sean MacLeod doesn't sound in this case like a man in pursuit of trends, or of clocks. He sounds like a man contented in the work of creation itself — still inquisitive, still on the prowl for that magic chorus, still penning songs that sound like they're good for your bones. Cool Charisma is not another album single; it's evidence that pop, when crafted correctly, can still be magic.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Rusty Reid's The Unreasonables is just such a treasure — a forgotten double album of sharp hooks, insurgent melodies, and unapologetic rock attitude, made decades past and only now given its life. It is no retro project; it is a rebirth. Four decades or so on from when it was first adhered to and put on the back burner, the album is an epiphany and a miracle, a reminder of what could have been and what still very much is.<br><br>Reid, an American singer-songwriter from Texas living in the Pacific Northwest today, is a seasoned artiste for his introspective indie-folk and country-rock discography. But The Unreasonables shatters that vision. This is not a thinking or philosophical record. It's an elemental, sweat-drenched explosion of rock and roll — lusty, raw, alive. No sweeping manifestos, no incendiary epics. Simply a band tearing along at full cry, sawing out riffs and melodies with the kind of freedom you get when you don't think anyone's paying attention.<br><br>It starts with Attitude Change, a catchy, sassy pop-rock jangle that gets the tone just right — hooky, confident, and frayed at the edges. It's the sort of track that would've fit neatly between Tom Petty and The Pretenders on FM radio in the early '80s, the sort you crank up loud in the car with the windows down. Piece of the Action comes with swing and swagger, sultry rhythm and sneer grin. Shock Me turns it up, a thudding come-on tune that's like a neon light turning on, and Let's Just Talk chills the temperature just enough to show the doubt behind the bluff.<br><br>It's easy to imagine The Unreasonables having held their own during their era — much the same as groups like The Cars, Dire Straits, and The Romantics all did the best they could to straddle radio-friendly hooks with subtlety strangeness. And yet, hearing it today, there's still something contemporary to it too. The snappiness of the melodies, the rough-around-the-edges sincerity, the lack of overproduction — it's precisely what modern rock could use more of.<br><br>There is also something oddly cinematic about this re-discovery. The tale of a lost group, an unreleased album that did not get heard, and a musician who carried that specter in silence all these years — it's like a sub-plot from Almost Famous or a strand out of Richard Linklater's Everybody Wants Some!!. You can almost envision a stack of reels unopened in a garage, the tape slightly gritty but otherwise unmolested, waiting for someone to press play once more.<br><br>Rusty Reid has never written with intent, usually putting politics or philosophy in his work, but The Unreasonables takes all that away. It is the sound of passion — passion over dogma, beat over brain. What is remarkable is how up-to-date it still is. Melodies have not aged at all. Guitars are crunchy and thumping. Vocals come alive with sarcasm and humor.<br><br>Reid's decision to finally put out The Unreasonables is both nostalgic and defiant. In an era of music culture beset by algorithmic sheen and streaming numbers, here's an album from a previous age of purpose — where a group could plug in, play from the heart, and let the tape run. It's sloppy, human, and full of personality.<br><br>For readers of old-style rock storytelling, The Unreasonables lie between the peppery bite of The Kinks and blue-collar heartland romance of Bruce Springsteen's early albums. It has that same stubbornness and humanity — songs by people who weren't attempting to be famous, but real.<br><br>Hearing it today is like discovering a letter written some time in the past but with the ability to speak to the present. It's not revival. It's confirmation that great music never truly dies — it merely awaits the moment when it will be re-rediscovered.<br><br>And here is finally, then: The Unreasonables. Rusty Reid and his long-forgotten band didn't disappear — they were patiently waiting for the world to catch up.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Since its inception by chief songwriter, guitarist, and producer Miguel, the band has carved out a niche that places introspection beside play, DIY ethics beside pop gloss. Its latest single, Fall Behind, out September 19, 2025, demonstrates that the band can evolve while remaining uncompromisingly themselves.<br><br>Recorded in the Flowers on the Wall, Fall Behind is an intentional shift from the melancholy atmosphere of The Shrubs' earlier music to a brighter, more energetic and eclecticism. The song takes cue from surf rock textures, recalling the sizzling-summer-guitar strums of The Bambi Molesters and The Ventures. But it never does feel like an imitation. Instead of avoiding the past, though, Miguel's precise songwriting and production mix nostalgia with modern sensibilities to create a retro and still newly current sound. Analogue recording technology yields warmth and texture, giving the single a retro tone that coexists with its brash guitar riffs and bright rhythmic momentum.<br><br>The group's do-it-yourself aesthetic is also at the core of what they're all about. Although they occasionally supplement their sound by adding a string quartet, The Shrubs prefer to produce everything in-house, writing, recording, and producing it themselves. This gives their music raw intimacy and detail, a deliberate control of tone and atmosphere that bigger studios dissipate. On Fall Behind, everything is measured and life-sounding—the guitars tend to sparkle, the rhythm section moves forward with energy, and Sophie Mallory's vocals float smoothly on top, adding a touch of humanity to surf-inspired hooklines.<br><br>Lyrically, Fall Behind is reflective and optimistic in equal proportion, offering themes of introspection, development, and tension between then and now. Six years of songwriting chops since 2019, when the track was composed, have yielded a sharp skillset in pairing narrative complexity with earworm hooks on Miguel's behalf. The energy of the track is contagious, so it's equally adept to quiet home listening as hangout dancing or cruises along sunny interstate highways.<br><br>The Shrubs' path is just one part of the larger resurgence of analog-sounding indie bands that incorporate vintage sounds with new attitudes, much like current psych-pop artists like Mild High Club or Temples. For those into surf rock revivalists like La Luz or early Tame Impala, The Shrubs will feel like home in terms of texture, but they add their own Texas flair—a earthy warmth and sense of humor that make the music fun and accessible. Their earlier output, seen as widely observed in placements such as the One Wheel electric skateboard commercial, had already shown itself capable of striking a chord beyond niche usage, and Fall Behind does it again while extending further into an experimental audio strategy.<br><br>The live band configuration, led by Miguel and his brother Josh on drums, with Sophie Mallory on vocals, has been made strong by testing and adaptation. The chemistry among the trio is working, and it allows for a fluidity that leaves room for both considered production choices and abrupt jolts of creativity. On Fall Behind, it's clear that The Shrubs are not content to ride previous success-they want to push themselves, refine their craft, and explore fresh musical ground while being respectful of the textures and tones that have defined them.<br><br>For indie rock fans with substance and soul, Fall Behind is a rich, immersive listen. Combine it with albums like La Luz's Weirdo Shrine, Mild High Club's Timeline, or even the guitar-driven cuts on Tame Impala's Innerspeaker for a playlist that walks the line between retro warmth and contemporary psych energy. Visually and culturally, it recalls the sun-bleached color of films like Rushmore or The Endless Summer, where mood, melody, and the curiosity of youth intersect seamlessly.<br><br>Fall Behind is more than a single song; it's an encapsulation of a band assured in its identity, but eager to explore. As The Shrubs mature and mature, their audience can look forward to songs that are laughingly introspective, modern and eternal, capturing the spirit of indie rock while pushing its unlimited potential. This new offering is an invigorating testament to the band's transformation and a tantalizing glimpse at what's to come from Houston's intriguing psych rock trio.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

Merging inspiration from genre icons such as Carl Cox with the sleek, contemporary production of Martin Ikin, he brings the fire with his lively live shows, catchy basslines, and thrusting beats. Combine inspiration from influencers such as James Hurr, Mark Knight, and Jewel Kid, and what you have is a sound both familiar and uncompromisingly energetic, a signature sound that is certain to take hold from the initial beat.<br><br>STYLEX's studio work illustrates acute sensitivity to rhythm and melody, and the capacity to create tracks ready to feature on the club floor yet emotionally engaging. Early singles such as Got This and Bandolera on Mustache Crew Records stamped him as a producer who could weave catchy hooks with driving energy, and Corrupt on AK Cartel further deepened his repertoire. His vocal-driven single Falling Deep on G Mafia Records uncovered a less typical side, injecting emotional richness otherwise delivered only by punchy, percussive beats.<br><br>His new release, Feel The Heat on Krafted Digital, is an optimal-impact tech house peak-hour floor-filler. Every synth stab, every percussive strike, and every cyclical bassline is programmed with one intention only to get a crowd moving, so standing still is out of the question. There is a cinematic aspect to the production, too, evoking memories of Hakkasan frequent flyers' high-octane performances but infused with STYLEX's own unique stamp, so repeat plays are mandatory. The set is reminiscent of a conversation between the dance floor and the booth, an unspoken recognition that the energy is reciprocated, not coerced. <br><br>STYLEX is also a master behind the decks. As host of Data Transmission Radio's Tech House Unleashed show, he previews his sets that reveal sharp ears and deep respect for the genre's heritage. His live sets are captivating, with seamless segues, witty layering, and an emphasis on feeling the room. While his DJing is only three years old, he possesses the composure and maturity of a seasoned pro with him, exuding confidence while still being in touch with the crowd.<br><br>For those who want more of his sound, Feel The Heat is sitting easily in the same place as Martin Ikin's Hooked or Jewel Kid's Bangs, offering an equally frantic, club-oriented experience. Those familiar with Carl Cox's early days of festival anthems or Mark Knight's floor-smashing tech house will hear the familiar nods of STYLEX's production style, but his music is also fresh and uncompromising in its own right. Aside from tracks and concerts, his work is the crowd high of electronic music — the sensation of dancing in masses to a beat that will not let you sit down.<br><br>STYLEX persists as an evolving force, marrying rush-hour choruses with moments of vocal declaration and melodic suspense. His rise in recent years portends a career that could define global dance floors, not just as a DJ or producer, but as one voice with a vision.

Stephanie Happening, known for translating resilience and identity into electrifying music, returns with Smash Hits, a single that feels both intimate and expansive. The track balances raw emotional honesty with production that’s as polished as it is exhilarating, a combination that positions Stephanie not just as a singer-songwriter but as a storyteller for a generation navigating reclamation and self-discovery.<br><br>From the first shimmering synth, Smash Hits asserts itself as a survivor-coded anthem. It captures that precise moment of breaking free, of shedding past constraints and reclaiming power, whether on screen, on stage, or in the private theaters of personal growth. Bold hooks meet soaring textures, creating a soundscape that is cinematic without ever feeling distant. It’s a track that’s built to move the body while speaking directly to the heart, a balance that few artists navigate so confidently.<br><br>Stephanie Happening’s work is inseparable from their lived experience. As an artist managing life with Dissociative Identity Disorder, their music carries a rare emotional specificity and layered storytelling. Every beat, every vocal turn is informed by themes of survival, resilience, and identity reclamation. Smash Hits continues this thread, pairing the euphoria of a danceable rhythm with the weight of lived experience, creating music that functions as both escape and reflection.<br><br>Listeners familiar with artists like Rina Sawayama or Christine and the Queens will recognize a similar fearless blending of pop sensibilities with theatrical storytelling. Yet Stephanie’s voice feels uniquely their own — unflinching, urgent, and unapologetically real. The track invites comparisons to the cathartic moments in films like Promising Young Woman or the visual storytelling of contemporary music videos from FKA twigs, where empowerment and defiance play out in vivid, layered ways.<br><br>The production of Smash Hits is both cinematic and immediate. Synth layers shimmer and pulse with kinetic energy, while the hook lands with a satisfying snap, demanding both attention and participation. The single demonstrates Stephanie’s keen ear for sync-ready moments, the kind of track that could score a montage of self-realization or play in a club where the collective energy mirrors the song’s narrative of liberation.<br><br>What makes Smash Hits stand out is its ability to be both personal and universal. While the song carries the specificity of Stephanie’s lived experience, its themes of empowerment, healing, and self-definition resonate broadly. It’s music that affirms identity while inviting listeners to move, to feel, and to witness themselves in the story being told.<br><br>Stephanie Happening continues to shape a distinctive space in alt-pop, where the cinematic and the personal meet, where hooks are weapons of reclamation, and where emotion drives the rhythm. Smash Hits is a declaration of presence, a moment of defiance that encourages listeners not only to dance but to confront and embrace their own truths. For those seeking alt-pop that is both visceral and reflective, this track aligns with the work of contemporary innovators while staking out its own luminous territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",
