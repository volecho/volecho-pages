            "content_html": "<p>Portland upstart Micki XO turns fatigue into joy on new single \"Power Outage,\" released today. A burst of electropop throb, bursts of fizzy noise, and a drop that hits like lightning, the song embodies the sensation of being running on fumes but somehow still having the getup to dance through.<br><br>At its core, \"Power Outage\" is a burnout song — the media overload, the never-ending cycle of politics, the grind of having two or three jobs. Micki is crooning about being tired and worn down, but the music springs to life, as if having the courage to declare that joy can still cut through the haze. The contrast is deliberate. \"It's about offering an escape,\" says Micki. \"Even for a few minutes, you get to forget the worry and refuel.\"<br><br>That epiphany was the result of a very literal power outage. Written from the midst of one of Portland's worst ice storms, when Micki had no electricity for almost two weeks, the solitary was based on the eerie tranquility of being disconnected. Without the ubiquitous illumination of screens, she knew sleep, silence, and focus. That paradox — that deprivation of power might, in fact, energize her — was the genesis of the song.<br><br>The track hums with nods to references so expansive as Lady Gaga, Rezz, and Dua Lipa. It becomes trance-like but motor, club-ready but intimate in a way that's safe for listening on headphones. Micki weaves hope into the rhythm, making \"Power Outage\" something of an anthem for anybody who feels pulled too thin but won't stay down.<br><br>Since starting her music career in pandemic year 2020, Micki XO has established herself on the Pacific Northwest circuit by playing at The Nines Hotel and Atlantis Lounge, releasing eight singles, and working with musicians around the globe. With several more releases in the works for 2025 and 2026, she is curating a catalog that blends sparkling pop with actual human heft.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>The velvet rope and bottle service are a thing of the past. Solo artist Exzenya reinterprets the term in one way she can on her new song V.I.P.: Victim's Impact Panel. Rather than hard partying, the tune raises awareness about the voluntary program developed by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) that the offenders must visit after being charged with a DUI. It's a risky, forward-thinking move incorporating humor, candor, and bass-driven beats to talk about something everyone would rather avoid.<br><br>Right out of the starting gate, V.I.P. releases driving beats and unflinching bars, dragging the listener into a realm where satire and straight-up storytelling intersect. Court dates, cautionary stories, and dark humor-grudging responsibility all bubble up. The track doesn't idealize bad decisions, but it also doesn't sermonize. Rather, Exzenya knocks the other side into witty rhymes and hooks that have you nodding your head, chuckling, and pondering—and sometimes in the same sentence.<br><br>\"These lyrics turn reality on its head,\" says Exzenya. \"V.I.P. is about taking the worst, most cringe-worthy things in life and making them completely unforgettable. It's sick, it's sickening, and it's brutally honest.\"<br><br>The single comes first, as plain as can be, with a Clean Version and a Club Remix to come, sure to move the concept further yet through moods and listeners. As post-afterparty sequel to a courtroom tale told at an afterparty, every version reimagines the encounter without losing its bite.<br><br>For Exzenya, this release is right at home in a line-blurring discography. She's long made a living as a shrewd cultural observer, able to move seamlessly between intensely personal concept albums (Story of My Life) and, ironically, satirical analyses of nightlife and gossip-mongering (Bar Scenes, Rumors). Her background in communications and psychology manifests itself in every lyric, slicing through human psychology with humor and empathy.<br><br>Hip-hop has long thrived on flipping the script—think Kendrick Lamar’s “Swimming Pools” unraveling party culture, or The Last Poets bending street-level reality into performance poetry. V.I.P. joins that lineage, confronting consequence with swagger and satire. If court-mandated programs rarely leave an impression beyond tedium, Exzenya has turned one into a head-nodding cautionary tale you’ll actually want to revisit.<br><br>V.I.P. can be found anywhere today, making Exzenya a singer with the power to make the somber and the ridiculous unforgettable. It's not simply a hip-hop song. It's a cheeky reminder that even on our worst moments, there's a beat worth listening to—and maybe a lesson worth gleaned.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>San Antonio native Jeremy Parsons has gained a following quite quietly, combining Americana, country, and dashes of electronica into a familiar, modern sound. Parsons started out in high school when the guitar became his tool for feeling and reflection. However, Parsons did have a talent for writing songs beyond melodies, condensing the harsh realities of life in Texas into a sense of honesty that would later become his hallmark. He has honed that craft since then, touring America and Europe, winning fans over with performances that are almost intimate in feel despite the numbers of people attending.<br><br>Having three full-length albums to his credit, Parsons has set an ongoing standard for sincerity and profundity. In 2023, he started to issue singles from his new EP, Life, with each offering showing the growth of an artist capable of maneuvering personal vulnerability and radio-friendly hook-crafting with equal finesse. His singles have consistently performed well, a few charting in the top regions of the UK iTunes charts and gathering more than 1.5 million streams on Spotify. Singles like Humanity and Life Worth Dyin' For have further cemented his sound on the radio, the latter charting as the number one National Radio Hits AC40 and Country airplay chart. Awards soon followed, with Parsons winning the 2024 New Music Award for Country Breakthrough Artist of the Year, and reaching the final of the 2024 New Folk Competition.<br><br>Parsons' new release, The Garden, shows him to be able to make remembrance and reflection into music that happens. Taken from his childhood and observations of mental illness, the song reached #45 on the Billboard Digital Songs Sales chart to affirm the success of his extremely personal music. Having that in mind, his latest release, Who Was I?, available September 5, offers an even more personal exploration of his growing-up. Born as a tongue-in-cheek reaction to a critic who had questioned the personal introspection of his 2021 album Things To Come, the song turned into an examination of youth, errors, and consciousness. Parsons looks back at life at age 25 with bald honesty that few songwriters have ever come close to, making confessional lines an universal reference point.<br><br>Couplets such as Sleeping through the days, living for the night / Yeah doing lots of things to see if I could die face up to the search and risk of youth, and his suave, leathery voice bring the tale into a real, human voice. Perhaps more than anything, Who Was I? equates Parsons' American roots with unflashy playing that supports but never overpowers, letting space for the tale to breathe. Jason Isbell, John Moreland, and Brandi Carlile fans will discover traces of the same unflinching honesty and emotional sincerity, and the fans of Boyhood and Lady Bird movies, which lay bare the complexity of coming-of-age and self-realization, will discover the cinematic sound in Parsons' songs.<br><br>The song, and earlier success, places Parsons as a voice reflective at a personal level but universal in appeal, one to be comforting for anyone passing through their own past. Parsons continuing to release songs from the Life EP establishes the precedent. Parsons is an artist who derives from experience lived, giving it back in music both personal and universal. With several new singles on the horizon, he is quietly gathering a body of work that will have him expand the parameters of Americana without ever losing sight of the type of storytelling that has made the genre so appealing for so long. Who Was I?<br><br>and the entire EP streams on MTS Records everywhere, inviting new listeners and longtime ones to come aboard Parsons as he looks back while looking ahead in an odd sense of direction and disconnection. For fans of contemplative country-inflected storytelling, this is music to spend time with. Pair a listening session with a late-night drive, a quiet coffee shop, or a walk through familiar streets, and you’ll understand why Jeremy Parsons is emerging as one of Americana’s most introspective and resonant voices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>Occasionally, an artist chooses to bring things back to basics. For Colourshop, London-bred, Barcelona-residing songwriter, his latest single Sailing Boat is that time. Out September 6, 2025, the single presents a bare-bones, acoustic sound that's at once intimate and gently insistent. Finally, after years of experimentation with changing sonic colors, Colourshop wagers everything on something less tense but by no means small-time. What ensues is a ballad that retains the bossa nova beat but also possesses a lyrical heaviness that lingers long after the song has finished its final fade.<br><br>Cut at RoomTo Studio in association with producers Oscar Bragado and Jason Boshoff, and featuring Bryan Curtis behind the drums, Sailing Boat glides with a nonchalance that appears to be planned. The sound never overwhelms the message, rather allowing the gentle guitar, loose percussion, and breezy rhythm to lead the listener. Its tone is that of Kings of Convenience's dainty clarity, Lianne La Havas's soulful nuance, and that stripped-back vulnerability that has characterized Damien Rice for so long. As with all those bands, Colourshop derives magic from restraint.<br><br>Essentially, Sailing Boat is more than a love ballad or introspective work of acoustic pop. It is a paean to mastery—or its failure. The maritime metaphor cuts deep, setting life as an endless dance with powers outside of our hands. The winds blow, the tides shift, and the best we can do is steer when we are able and let go when we cannot. In a universe that so celebrates control and certainty, Colourshop's message is one of the loveliness of release. Floating occasionally creates the most incredible views.<br><br>The message of this song is particularly pertinent in an era where doubt has become something of a ubiquitous shadow. It's an album that'll have listeners reminiscing about albums that conveyed the same emotions, whether it's Nick Drake's Pink Moon, Norah Jones's Come Away With Me, or even the movie-like calmness of João Gilberto's original bossa nova recordings. Like those, Sailing Boat won't be racing ahead. It encourages you to sit with it, to breathe a bit more slowly, and to notice that meaning does not always lie in where you arrive but in the way you arrive there.<br><br>Colourshop's relocation to Barcelona is on this as well. There's a sun-soaked tranquility to the song that is fitting for the Mediterranean terrain—something in which the sea itself is both source and metaphor. This relocation has the sense of less of an afterthought and more of a shift of direction, sending him toward something greater and more contemplative, as if the change of terrains served to shed fat to reveal something more intimate.<br><br>For aficionados of indie folk and acoustic soft-pop, Sailing Boat will be that late-night favorite—best consumed during a lonely walk home, or on Sunday afternoons when time slows down. It stands with the introverted closeness of Iron &amp; Wine's early era, the emotive dignity of Laura Marling, or the ambient coziness of José González. But even amongst that throng, the tone of Colourshop stands out, clean and sincere in intention.<br><br>This release might be viewed as turning inwards, but it is every bit an opening out—a widening of perspective that extends the invitation to the listener. Colourshop has written a track that acknowledges the turn of life, yet prefers to find comfort in its necessity. Sailing Boat is not a song about finding direction, it's one that finds that sometimes direction finds you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">Melbourne experimental group Transgalactica is forcing us to rethink the nature of music and its role in daily life with their ephemeral release Marginal Music. For the most part, the release is all about the irony of contemporary culture consumption: where there were streaming sites, subscription platforms, and torrential masses of available digital music, now the marginal cost of listening to music has essentially hit zero. Transgalactica's music teases out what that looks like for both the listener and artist—while the masses are enjoying unprecedented freedom, talented artists must fend for themselves, relying on teaching, mixing, or wedding gigs rather than solely their art.<br><br>The group's newest release, Discounted Blessings, thematizes this tension in a fearlessly conceptual manner. The song is argumentative and contemplative in the introduction and verses, then descending into a catastrophic progressive metal bridge that addresses how much is on the line when the quality of music is neglected. It's thematically disapproving of corporate control of the industry, citing monopoly gaming of live performances by corporations such as Live Nation, and lightheartedly invites one to ponder the long-term ramifications of indulging in low-effort, commercially oriented music. Transgalactica even takes the step of suggesting a pseudo-scientific hypothesis: listening to \"trashy\" music during your lifetime dooms you to an eternity of hearing it, a tart comment on cultural value and aesthetics.<br><br>Texture and sound-wise, the work is a dense blend. The group takes material from Bizet's opera Carmen, overlaying classical with new electronica and metal material to create tension between old and new consumption. The sound that follows is cerebral and visceral, requiring attention space with room for thought. It's a testament to the means by which music may be at once personal, social, and abstract, calling to the fans of artists like Matmos, The Books, or early Bjork, where odd shapes and meta-reflection on culture are paired.<br><br>Transgalactica's interviews are as irreverent, humorous, and unapologetic as their sound. They talk of hypocrisy in enjoying free content but giving tips on how to sustain support via streaming instead of paying directly. They marvel at the limitations of choice under contemporary music, citing how corporate interests primarily determine who is seen and how the fans consume, echoing complaints under discussion of cultural gatekeeping such as 24 Hour Party People or films like Artifact.<br><br>Early responses boast both intellectual sophistication and playfully irreverent humor of Transgalactica. Both critics and admirers applaud the endeavor for straddling the thin line between criticism and amusement, maintaining a urbane equipoise that is neither alienating nor impenetrable. Marginal Music invites listeners to consider their own position in the world of culture as well as offering up an ample, genre-defying audio experience.<br><br>For listeners who'd love to hear more of these concepts explored, the song nestles into comfortable territory with experimental and socially conscious music projects. Imagine Jon Hopkins' complex textures, Laurie Anderson's narrative, or even The Flaming Lips' more abstract conceptual endeavors. On video, the systems' breakdown and culture that we witness in Her or Sorry to Bother You is matched by the same questions Transgalactica raises of music, value, and control. Marginal Music is a challenging work which repays close listening and attention with humor, wit, and solid musicianship articulated as an organic whole.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">By the time you press play on Kristina Wilson's debut album Dating Broken Boys, released October 4, 2025, you'll know that you're in for something better than just another set of indie break-up songs. The Australian singer-songwriter has taken her Forestville apartment break-up session and planted it in a richly textured album half insightful observation, half confession, and half sarcastic humor. It's all about bad habits, self-destruction, and relief from laughing at oneself when the tears dry.<br><br>The album takes its title from Kristina's world constructed with Dumbitchitis, the acerbic single with indie-pop group Like Angels. The song, cheekily titled, and its painfully real lyrics about lingering too long in the bad love affair, is the thesis of the album: we all fall for things, occasionally for the people who don't deserve them, and the result is both tragic and comic. \"It's like if you've got a love infection when you're in love with somebody — or in love with who they are,\" Kristina explained the song, saying it was too ridiculous and too true to be left out of a song.<br><br>Dating Broken Boys seems to have come out of all those same moments — late-night cheap wine talks, sobbing to strangers who temporarily turn into overnight therapists, lengthy texts on your phone that you will never send. Kristina's writing is like a bedroom whisper but with the sting of a barbed-wire fence, the one that will leave you laughing at how damn ridiculous love makes us.<br><br>Musically, the album combines indie-pop, alt-folk, and rocks of inspiration into a paintbox that's fresh yet old. You get to hear the raw reality of Phoebe Bridgers, block anecdote politeness of Julia Jacklin, and rhythmic push of HAIM, but Kristina is not riding on her idols' coattails — she's carving out her own strip. Co-produced by Ethan Saunders and Ian Mehrle, the album weighs lean, folk-strained arrangements against larger moments that punch like a live show closer.<br><br>It's the type of arrival that doesn't only guarantee a career but that heralds an artist who's already a hell of a lot smarter than she needs to be. While other newcomers dance around genericities, Kristina Wilson plays for keeps. Her songs don't shy away from calling out the dirty things — the message you never should've sent, the ex you just can't help returning to, the stinging realization you weren't ever in love so much as addicted to drama.<br><br>Albums such as these cannot help but compare to pop culture icons. If Bridgers provided us with Punisher as the post-shift self-doubt playlist, and Olivia Rodrigo penned SOUR as the car scream during puberty, then Dating Broken Boys is in the middle ground — a rawly honest diary that still will not stop winking at you. It has the bite of Fleabag’s monologues and the bittersweet humor of a Greta Gerwig film, packaged in hooks you’ll hum long after.<br><br>Kristina has stated that she wished the record to have a mirror or friend quality about it, and she's achieved it. These songs are not written from a pedestal; they're written from the floor, cross-legged with you, laughing through the pain and scheming the next move. It's catharsis that doesn't get heavy-handed, healing that doesn't attempt to sound neat.<br><br>Dating Broken Boys is out October 4 on all platforms. If you’ve ever rolled your eyes at your own poor choices while secretly queuing up another sad-girl playlist, Kristina Wilson has made the album for you.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">Ashia Ackov's latest single, \"In Time,\" is an introspection on memory, love, and the subdued burden of sacrifice. Going back to the legacy of Jazz Noire, the song finds inspiration in Ackov's grandparents and the tale of the 92nd Infantry soldiers who abandoned their brides when they shipped out for war. That tug-of-war between faith and doubt—\"Do I ever get to see you again? Is it worth it?\"—is the emotional center of this song, making it rich with depth that resonates long after the last note has dissolved. The music from the first chord is imbued with introspective warmth. Piano melodies roll along in subdued determination, conjuring waves, and muted brass provides illuminating wisps of soft, wistful light onto the story. An insistent rhythm propels the song along like a pulse, anchoring the listener in the force of chronology in the tale. Ackov's voice remains at the forefront, unbroken and slow, each line charged with history, desire, and a quiet hope that bridged past to present.<br><br>Listening to \"In Time\" is like reading a movie, the feeling of being ushered into one of the classic black-and-white films where a bride gestures farewell while a soldier slumps out of the window of an open train and remains suspended in tender promise. It's what makes this song so beautiful: its narrative. Ackov's music was always textured, but in this piece, the storytelling is simple and suggestive. The song doesn't just tell a phenomenon—s/he invites the audience to live it.<br><br>For music lovers who like music that fuses history and emotion, \"In Time\" will touch a chord, being a class of modern jazz ballads paying tribute to individual and shared memory, like Norah Jones' reflective songs or Gregory Porter's storytelling tradition. On Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, and Amazon, \"In Time\" is a listen and commentary on measuring love and legacy. For emotionally charged, movie-inspired jazz fans, the song is one to listen to, giving way to a moment of pause for stories that are both personal, historical, and universal.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "summary": "There's something great about seeing an artist come into their own, and&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\">There's something great about seeing an artist come into their own, and Melbourne's Jacqui Beaa appears to be doing just that. Her third single Grid Me substitutes some of the raw emotion of her early work with a self-confident, groove-based anthem that struts its stuff brazenly while still having a hurtful bite. It's the sort of song that straddles dancefloor sing-along and bedroom diary confession, and it's all parts fun and oh-so-relatable.<br><br>At first listen, Grid Me is a breezy indie-pop anthem — jaunty basslines, jangly guitar chords, and a hooky beat that dares you not to get up and dance. But beneath its glittering surface is a nicer, more nuanced question that most of us have grappled with privately: why has my boyfriend never posted a photo of us on the internet? In an era where more frequently than not, relationships turn into a scoreboard, Beaa captures the paranoia and the humor of wondering whether love exists if it doesn't get pinned on the grid.<br><br>It's this equilibrium — flippant but poignant, danceable but introspective — that makes Grid Me mainstream. The song does not lecture and indulge. Rather, it smirks at the silliness of insecurities during an era of screens and declares just how much it still hurts. It's nearly the same as with the narrative strategy of Paramore's Still Into You, where cloying hooks are jammed up against honest emotional jabs. Listeners who have found themselves caught between laughing at their own neuroses and being bludgeoned by them will understand here.<br><br>Beaa's journey to this point is as complicated as her music. Born in Melbourne, she learned to play the guitar at four and spent her teenage years writing songs before breaking onto the city's pub and festival scene. At 20, she derailed into writing, directing and performing short films and even co-writing a mini musical for the 2023 Melbourne International Comedy Festival. It was a learning experience that honed her storytelling and theater skills, skills now spilling over into songwriting. When she came back to music with her debut single full-tilt later in 2024, it was apparent that she had found a voice that was both gritty and lovable.<br><br>Grid Me is a peak on this new chapter. It's like the song where Beaa owns it — assertive, clever, and unapologetically relatable. Maggie Rogers' ecstatic introspection fans or G Flip's honest, beat-driven pop lovers will discover a lot to adore here. And there's a hint of Ed Sheeran's ability to take normal worries and turn them into hooky, inescapable earworms that still replay long after the track has finished.<br><br>There’s also something cinematic about the track. The paranoia of waiting for your relationship to be Instagram official feels like the kind of subplot you’d catch in a Netflix coming-of-age film, nestled between moments of romantic comedy and heartbreak. Imagine To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before but with the stakes updated for the TikTok generation.<br><br>With only three singles to her name, Jacqui Beaa is on the first pages of her life as an artist, but Grid Me offers a glimpse of where she is going. Her skill in converting tiny doubts into songs that radiate confidence is a worthwhile accomplishment, one that separates a songwriter from an artist. You can all too easily imagine Grid Me blasting over festival crowds, the sort of song that individuals dance to with friends while silently wondering why somebody can't respond to their texts.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p>There is something filmic to a song that sounds like somewhere. Cannock music tutor Richard Standley, who devotes his weekdays to getting primary school kids to sing scales and tunes, has gone and done just this with his first single Neighbourhood Vibes. Released September 13, 2025, the song sounds like the sound of suburban streets at twilight, headlights sweeping around corners, children pedaling bicycles, the thrum of everyday life morphing into something more charged.<br><br>Standley is a familiar face on the stage—he plays weekends with a covers band—but this single marks his first excursion into original electronica. Far from being trend-driven, he resorts to instincts built up over years of listening and tutoring. His influences manifest themselves in knowing guise. There's a touch of The Prodigy in the punch and energy, an homage to The Killers in magnitude and star appeal, and a retro video game nostalgia undertone in the arpeggiated synths that evoke pixelated 80s and 90s landscapes.<br><br>The record clocks in at more than five minutes, Neighbourhood Vibes doesn't drag on. The song is presented as a night on the town that never stops changing—dancing to slick synth hooks one moment, finding oneself inexplicably stuck in some arpeggio flashback that teeters perilously on the brink of the meditative, before the beat kicks in again and the rhythm of possibility takes over. It's the kind of track that's just as good heard on headphones in isolation on a ride out as it is being blasted out of speakers before a night out with the lads.<br><br>There's also a refreshing freshness to the way Standley creates music. This is not the formulaic output of a producer searching for the formula; this is an album made in between lesson plans and Saturday afternoon broadcasts, with the same enthusiasm that goes into teaching a child their first chord. That tension between discipline and play you can hear in the music—disciplined enough to draw you in, but loose enough to breathe.<br><br>If you were to place Neighbourhood Vibes in amongst the rest, it would sit between the retro glow of Kavinsky, the melodic narration of M83, and the lead-and-centre, pulse-pounding beats of early Chemical Brothers. There's a filmic gloss that wouldn't be amis on a score—see the way electronic textures in Drive smeared neon desolation with adrenaline.<br><br>In the end, Standley built something subtly great: an album that resembles plain streets inflated to enormity. It's the park on the block, the line of houses, the small-town nightlife—all remixed and reprised on synths, beat, and imagination. With Neighbourhood Vibes, he's made a suburban English stillness a theater, and it's the sort of debut that will be remembered long after the final note is forgotten.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",

            "content_html": "<p><br>Melbourne's Ratfink! are back with a snappy message. New single Plastic Bits, the third release from the forthcoming album When U Were Mine, sees the band's unique blend of three-chord rock energy and surf pop gloss. There's a hooky catchiness to the song which reminds one of the way early garage rock could be both urgent and fun, the kind of song that catches your head on first play.<br><br>The stimulus is close to hand: the city's waterways. Afternoon spent on the Merri River's muddy banks was followed by the band considering the plastic that blanketed the landscape. That consciousness leaks into the song in little details, from the slightly out-of-tune guitar lines that mimic the disorientation of rubbish to the beat that skips like water over rocks. The album blends social observation with playfulness, proving that Ratfink! is able to speak about real-world concerns without sacrificing the energy of rock n roll.<br><br>Current fans will see the familiar hooks and brute power that have characterized their output, but new listeners might find an identical draw in how groups like The Strokes or Thee Oh Sees combine immediacy with melody. Plastic Bits is economical but powerful, a sleek primer to the more expansive soundscapes and narrative the band are venturing into with When U Were Mine. It's a reminder that rock music can still be new, paying attention, and starkly alive, even constructed out of three basic chords.<br><br>For those who dig music that blends grit and intelligent thinking, Plastic Bits is a bull's-eye. It's a song to crank up loud, to hear the city in a new way, and to get stoked on what Ratfink! has next.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>",
