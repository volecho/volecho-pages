            "content_html": "<p>In the hauntingly silent darkness of their July drop Winter on the Vine, Danish dark-pop group TRALALAS come back with Burns, a song that is its own subdued inflammatory. While the initial single mapped the cycles of transformation and clenched quiet of complicity, Burns turns in. At three and thirty seconds, it's close but sweeping, an exploration of the capriciousness of human relationship and the manner in which feelings ricochet back and forth between gain and loss, proximity and distance.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br>With songwriting and frontman Morten Alsinger as its core, TRALALAS construct their sound more as a group constructing atmosphere. You can feel it in the textures—warm analog production, Heidi Lindahl's ghostly harmonies twisting around Alsinger's voice, Christina Schmidt Damm's calm keys, Thomas Golzen's bass and guitar lines twining around the beat, and Francis Nørgaard Jensen's restrained percussion. Featuring Thomas Li on co-production, the track inhales with accuracy, every moment suspended between light and shadow.<br><br>Alsinger describes his writing as essayistic, and so it is. These are not free-floating lyrics. They are statements of mind abbreviated in action, inner voice expelled. His invocation of Montaigne—\"I write from the dark against the light\"—does as much to record not just the ethos of Burns but the larger enterprise being constructed on in TRALALAS' self-titled debut album out in October. The group don't require simplistic answers or moralities. They require perspective, the place where you end up when you stay with brokenness long enough for its rough edges to get in your face.<br><br>In that way, Burns is a companion piece to Winter on the Vine. Together, the two singles map out the territory for an album that will be an inner examination of vulnerability and intensity, composed not in slogans but in slow-burning patience. If Winter on the Vine was a lesson in circles, then Burns is about embers left over, the way love, friendship, and loss slice us open and leave us walking around the ashes searching for shape.<br><br>The music is in the dark-pop style of someone like Zola Jesus, Agnes Obel, or the more subdued edges of Depeche Mode, but TRALALAS form their own sound. The music is electric and muted, cinematic but not overwrought. It's the kind of song that doesn't sweep you in with bombast but sweeps you in with sound, until you find yourself leaning forward just to hear the next turn.<br><br>And at the end of Burns, there is left not just the lyric or the hook but the space between them. It is a record that requires repeat listens not because it is catchy in the traditional way, but because it leaves an emotional residue. And in that which remains, half shadow, half flame, you begin to see what TRALALAS are constructing towards: an album which harnesses the vulnerability as fuel rather than extinguishes it.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Marianne Nowottny has been a chameleon of a sort for all her working life. A composer, she has spent decades bending her voice to unearthly colors, stretching the limits of phrasing and atmosphere. Now, playing in her longtime alter ego Marzanna, she's pushed the cover album format in an album that is both predestined and unexpected. Plainly named Marzanna, the album combines covers of Kate Bush, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and others' songs, songs that have intrinsic strong signatures, but here drawn into darker, dreamier landscapes.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br>Covers aren't unfamiliar ground for Nowottny. She has dropped them around in her catalogue in records and live shows, Yazoo, Anne Murray, the Beatles, Nico, the Platters, Johnny Cash, Astrud Gilberto. But never has she given herself over entirely to the form. That's a central decision. It's not going back from writing to record an entire album of other people's work, but to claim a different type of writing: one that's informed by attentive listening, on shaping familiar melodies into new space until they're sounds like ghosts talking in new tongues.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4fdAOtFptYOG82sR6iIaOd?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br>She prolongs syllables so they hang, and shortens others with snapping sparks. That alone will set a mood, a mood where even the most familiar songs feel haunted, reborn. Hearing Marzanna sing Bowie or Joni Mitchell is to hear like the song is recalling itself in a dream, rewriting the edges of memory.<br><br>The making of the record wasn't easy. By the artist's own account, it nearly didn't happen at all. The five-year cycle of stoppages, respins, and technological catastrophes, crashed hard drives, misplaced songs, the plodding grind of start-over, should have killed the project a hundred times over. Instead, they imparted a sort of ruggedness. What ultimately came in sounds worn down by effort but unexpectedly calm, as if the perseverance it took to complete it infused the recordings themselves.<br><br>Marzanna did not embark on this trip alone. She extended a hand, calling in musicians and friends of all corners of the globe to carry their voices, their instruments, and themselves. That sense of camaraderie pervades the album, though mood continues ever her own. These are songs, also, with their revered beginnings concealed behind the illusion that they're being shared in hushed tones from room to room.<br><br>What is interesting about Marzanna is not that it reimagines the cover album, but that it tackles the concept uncharacteristically seriously. Rather than attempting to out-play the originals or play them ironically, Nowottny utilizes them as portals, familiar gateways that open up into foreign, fog-filled rooms. And in doing so, she demonstrates something about covers that is commonly lost: that they are not imitation or retro, but conversation. About how one hears a song differently from another's past, their phrasing, their suffering, their joy.<br><br>Through this album, Marzanna flips inside out the songs we thought we knew by heart, so we may hear them, as if for the very first time. It's not copy. It's revivification. And it echoes on long after the final note disappears.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>From the Cambrian moors to Bristol's streets of strife, Moletrap are sounding as tough and vital as the terrain that brought them up. The band release Mid Welsh, Pt 1, a five-track EP which manages to both use the crash of guitars and the gentle determination of Mid Wales itself. It is a record, not an album. It is a reckoning with identity, with language, and with what it's like to be from somewhere history books and pop culture have forgotten.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The EP is the product of being in good form. Early singles such as Rhagofn and Middle of the Land were widely hailed for their blend of melodic pop sensibilities and bone-crunching heaviness. BBC Introducing described the music as \"un-ignorably great\" and vowed \"a thousand mosh pits await.\" Which isn't hype. There is a sense of urgency to these songs that evokes the sense of getting on with it of early Manic Street Preachers, combined with the restless energy of current alt-rock bands like Idles.<br><br>What gives Mid Welsh, Pt 1 its bite is not so much the dynamics of the guitars or the authority of the vocals as the earthiness of experience. The members of the band met initially in Welsh-language school, where they once attempted to escape. When they left, all they could do was escape from what they had called \"the least settled part of Wales and England.\" Years later, however, music beckoned them back to their roots. They've discovered their own history, traced the unmarked routes of the Cambrians, and challenged how colonisation and erasure have left their mark on the Welsh language.<br><br>All that tension is crammed into every one of those songs. Nation of Sanctuary hails Wales' openness to the world, while Rhagofn cautions against smugness in respect of work remaining to be undertaken. Taffy and What a Beautiful Place gaze inward on issues of heritage and belonging, while the title track is more like a reclaimed anthem. Every cut is full of both urgency and sensitivity, as though the band are grasping something delicate even as they crank the volume to eleven.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4dBkAxAKrRa1w7DZNCuSvf?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br>Moletrap's sound is full of contradiction in the finest sense. They are bilingual but international, refined but abrasive, politicized but intensely personal. Their riffs crash and churn like the mountains to which they continually refer, but the melody soars with hooks that stick long after the distortion wears off. That dichotomy is what makes Mid Welsh, Pt 1 not only a potent debut album but an important cultural statement.<br><br>The band openly talk about the chaos of their musical creation, of jam sessions turned into something far larger. They credit BBC Horizons and all the DJs, writers, and communities that raised them up. That humility only makes the music more powerful. Moletrap are not faking to be saviors of Welsh heritage, but as three friends with guitars, drums, and resolve getting back to where they belong.<br><br>Listening to Mid Welsh, Pt 1, you can hear a band still working out their mythology but sounding as though already they have something profound in their hands. Their music is heavy enough to rattle halls but intelligent enough to contain a lesson in history in its chords. Ultimately, Moletrap do just what they aim to do. They sound like the Cambrian Mountains rolling downhill, unstoppable, unquietable.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"> </p>",

With Growing Pains, Anaïs takes her signature blend of indie pop, jazz, and folk, carrying it in a collection of nostalgia, playfulness, and pure energy.<br><br>For three years, Anaïs had worked on the six-song EP. After some time, she engaged Ben Coleman in the production, along with collaborators from the band and fellow New York musicians, so that each track would bear a particular collaborative flair. The spirit of togetherness even extended outside the immediate band, with her mom helping out in refining the lyrics for Anaïs's first-ever French-language piece, \"Passe le temps\"; meanwhile, a poem by her friend Alex Brady is incorporated into the track \"Cool.\" \"It's been fun to cobble together,\" she shares. \"Basically, every song was touched by someone in or around the live band.\"<br><br>Identity, nostalgia, and self-discovery are themes Anaïs continues to delve into on Growing Pains. The songs capture the struggle of growing up while still wanting to clutch onto that kid who used to be. \"These songs were some of the first I wrote that truly felt like me,\" says Anaïs. \"Most of these songs came together after I moved from Californ...\"</p>\n<p> The record comprises six tracks that feel deceptively warm and sincere, somewhere between indie pop, touches of jazz, and subtly inflected with folk, the kind of record one can almost touch, almost live with. Each track drops a shade into a different memory. </p>\n<p>In the time since her streaming footprint has been widening and social following mounting, Anaïs has built much repute as a highly magnetic live act. She has sold out her own headline shows, played at NXNE Music Festival in Toronto, and opened for the likes of Jade Bird and Thunder Jackson.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anaïs &amp; The Hoops is the project of Brooklyn-based, San Diego-raised singer and songwriter Anaïs Lund. She got her start performing in jazz clubs and restaurants before finding her own musical footing in 2019, when she began writing the songs that would shape her project, Anaïs &amp; The Hoops. With her jazz-inflected vocals, sharp yet vulnerable lyrics, catchy pop melodies, and a captivating retro aesthetic, Anaïs &amp; The Hoops is quickly establishing herself as one of indie music’s most distinctive new voices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"align-left\">A different release, full of surprises and unique elements taken from albums we love, with so many interesting influences in the sound. It is a unique jazz creation with exceptional vocals and a tremendous rhythm. The instruments resemble a well-oiled machine with a steady rhythm and precision of movement, which nevertheless sounds so natural and beautiful.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><br><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3uDOV2wz4myUGk2jgtZbaw?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div> <br><br></p>\n<p>The end result is a beautiful accompaniment of musical calls that flatter Anaïs' voice with a beautiful mix of different sounds, even including a guitar with light fuzz. If we had to describe this release, we would say that it is a breath of fresh air, especially in an era of fast songs and hits aimed at immediate recognition and artistic popularity.

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"50\" data-end=\"497\">With <em data-start=\"55\" data-end=\"73\">Man I Used To Be</em>, Dax steps into a new chapter of his career, one that trades bravado for reflection and rapid-fire bars for something closer to a prayer. Known first as a rapper with relentless delivery and sharp punchlines, he now turns his voice inward, creating a track that feels more like a confessional than a performance. The song is raw, slow-burning, and completely unafraid of silence, allowing space for every word to sink in.</p>\n<p data-start=\"499\" data-end=\"1020\">The heart of the track lies in its honesty. Dax addresses his past struggles with addiction and the regret that still lingers. He does not hide from the damage, nor does he glorify it. Instead, the lyrics read like a letter to his younger self, a direct confrontation with the man who once made choices that threatened to derail everything. The vulnerability here is striking. Hip hop has always made room for confession, but Dax delivers his with a mix of sorrow and resolve that feels different from his earlier work.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" data-start=\"499\" data-end=\"1020\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1v6KfzL3Tw4jt6eYM9l0Fk?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-start=\"1022\" data-end=\"1511\">What makes <em data-start=\"1033\" data-end=\"1051\">Man I Used To Be</em> stand out is the way it frames change. The song is not just about admitting mistakes. It is about the uncomfortable but necessary act of moving forward without erasing the past. Dax balances grief with gratitude, admitting how far he fell while also pointing to the faith that lifted him back up. His references to God are not heavy-handed, but they are central. They serve as proof that redemption is not an abstract concept for him. It is a lived reality.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1513\" data-end=\"1864\">The production mirrors this shift. Instead of dense beats or flashy arrangements, the track is anchored in soulful textures and a steady rhythm that gives Dax’s voice space to carry the weight of the story. Each line lands with gravity, but there is also a sense of release in the delivery, as if saying these things out loud is part of the healing.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1866\" data-end=\"2348\">The track signals a willingness to step outside the comfort zone of genre and persona, to make music that is not just catchy but necessary. In this way, <em data-start=\"2074\" data-end=\"2092\">Man I Used To Be</em> connects to the lineage of personal confessionals from artists like NF, Logic, and even 2Pac at his most reflective. Beyond rap, it recalls the emotional candor of gospel and the stark storytelling of singer-songwriters who let their pain shape the art.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2350\" data-end=\"2681\">For listeners, the song works as more than autobiography. It becomes a mirror. Anyone who has struggled with self-destruction, regret, or the slow climb toward change will hear echoes of themselves. The track does not offer easy solutions, but it does offer company in the struggle, which is often the most powerful form of hope.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2683\" data-end=\"3030\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">With <em data-start=\"2688\" data-end=\"2706\">Man I Used To Be</em>, Dax proves that growth can sound just as gripping as ambition. It is a reminder that vulnerability, when spoken plainly and set to music, can carry as much force as any verse meant to dominate a stage. This is not the sound of a rapper chasing hits. It is the sound of a man facing himself, and inviting us to listen in.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"42\" data-end=\"523\">Ana Luna’s new single <em data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"102\">Can We Pretend We Just Met at a Bar?</em> does not ask for your attention. It pulls you in the way late-night conversations do, with a quiet voice that says just enough to keep you leaning closer. Out today on all streaming platforms, the track deepens the emotional space she carved with earlier releases like <em data-start=\"372\" data-end=\"388\">Daddy’s Empire</em> and <em data-start=\"393\" data-end=\"412\">Dance in a Trance</em>. It is another step toward a debut album that already feels like it will be heavy with atmosphere and truth.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" data-start=\"42\" data-end=\"523\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PZfrXFK4/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"unnamed-2\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p data-start=\"525\" data-end=\"1073\">The production here is warm and cinematic, moving with the kind of slow-burn rhythm that never rushes its own heartbeat. Layers unfold in deliberate turns, each one letting Ana’s voice linger in the space it needs. She sings in a tone that feels equal parts intimate and wounded, the sound of someone turning over a thought again and again until it becomes both familiar and unbearable. You hear not just the longing in her delivery but also the quiet acceptance beneath it, a sense that she has already lived through the scene she is describing.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1075\" data-end=\"1612\">Ana calls the song a conversation with herself. It is about holding on to a version of the past that feels softer than the truth, about blurring memory and reality in an attempt to make sense of loss. In her words, she imagined the relationship as she wished it could have been, faced how it really was, and confronted the reason she stayed longer than she should have. That contradiction sits at the core of the song. The exterior of love can be hypnotic, keeping you tethered to something even as your inner voice pleads for an exit.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1614\" data-end=\"2065\">Born in Ukraine, raised in Paris, and now living in Los Angeles, Ana Luna writes with the range of someone who has collected places, faces, and private heartbreaks. She first kept her music to herself while chasing acting roles, but in college she gave in to what she calls the deeper pull. Her sound folds together dream pop shimmer, alt-rock shadows, and the stripped honesty of a ballad, creating something that feels both grounded and unearthly.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" data-start=\"1614\" data-end=\"2065\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2TBQYE0b55ZvUt5KCJHZUE?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-start=\"2067\" data-end=\"2499\"><em data-start=\"2067\" data-end=\"2105\">Can We Pretend We Just Met at a Bar?</em> fits into a lineage of slow, bruised storytelling.

Like those tracks, it asks you to sit in a moment rather than escape from it. The song rewards stillness. It offers a space where pain and beauty can occupy the same measure without canceling each other out.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2067\" data-end=\"2499\">Photo Credit: Noah Hoffman (<a href=\"https://twitter.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=942fde0b78cdd6bf718a77eff&amp;id=48117443a0&amp;e=920b55f0ef\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3D942fde0b78cdd6bf718a77eff%26id%3D48117443a0%26e%3D920b55f0ef&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1755382196751000&amp;usg=AOvVaw15EbDMYjcrW-hkRJshR8vt\" rel=\"noopener\">@conversingwithaliens</a>)</p>",

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"55\" data-end=\"534\">After years of quiet and a world reshaped by distance, Paperwhite returns with <em data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"141\">Reach</em>, a five-song collection that feels like it kept evolving even when we could not hear it. The sibling duo, Katie and Ben Marshall, have always worked in a space where feeling matters as much as sound. This time, though, their music lands with a different kind of presence. Not louder or heavier, just clearer. More grounded. Like they have carried the weight of time and turned it into melody.</p>\n<p data-start=\"536\" data-end=\"1009\">At the center of <em data-start=\"553\" data-end=\"560\">Reach</em> is <em data-start=\"564\" data-end=\"578\">Looking Back</em>, a track that holds its breath in the best way. It started early in the pandemic but only found its final shape with the help of composer Philip Sheppard. His string arrangements stretch through the track with quiet purpose. They do not overpower the synths. They move through them like something remembered rather than added. The result is a sound that feels both fragile and full, something built from memory rather than design.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" data-start=\"536\" data-end=\"1009\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3bz2WVtIw2Fr0fwrqc4Bs0?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-start=\"1011\" data-end=\"1487\">That is the strength of the entire EP. <em data-start=\"1050\" data-end=\"1057\">Reach</em> sounds like it was made by people who lived inside their ideas for a while before speaking them out loud. It holds moments gently. Nothing feels rushed. Katie’s vocals move with soft confidence, floating over Ben’s production in a way that gives space for emotion without losing structure. These are not songs meant to escape into. They are songs meant to sit with, especially in the in-between hours when silence feels too loud.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1489\" data-end=\"1997\">Ten years have passed since <strong>Paperwhite </strong>introduced themselves with <strong><em data-start=\"1555\" data-end=\"1563\">Escape</em></strong>. Back then, their sound fit neatly into a wave of glossy synth-pop made for headphone daydreams. You can still hear traces of that in the shimmer of this new EP. But there is more here. Organic layers. Soft acoustic touches. Lyrical choices that sound less like poetry and more like truth spoken plainly. It is pop music, but not in a way that pushes for attention. It is music that lets the listener come forward on their own terms.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1999\" data-end=\"2378\">There is a kind of patience in these songs that feels rare. Nothing here grabs at you. Instead, <em data-start=\"2095\" data-end=\"2102\">Reach</em> draws you in slowly, offering detail after detail the more you listen. It rewards stillness. These tracks are meant for early mornings or late nights, for quiet drives or open windows. They settle in without asking for anything, then stay with you in a way that feels earned.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2380\" data-end=\"2733\">Paperwhite still sound like themselves, which is saying something in a genre that often moves too fast to remember what came before. Listeners who love CHVRCHES or Japanese House will feel at home here, but <em data-start=\"2587\" data-end=\"2594\">Reach</em> does not borrow. It remembers. It reflects. It builds something personal out of familiar textures, using light and shadow with equal care.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2735\" data-end=\"3059\">The EP never rushes to its point. It trusts that you will get there. In a culture built on short attention spans, this feels quietly bold. Every song has room to breathe. Every lyric lands softly but carries weight. With each listen, what first felt dreamy becomes more detailed. What seemed simple reveals something deeper.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3061\" data-end=\"3350\">This is not a loud return. It is not a comeback with fireworks or declarations. It is something more honest. A steady hand reaching back out after time apart. A project that carries both softness and strength. A sound that knows where it came from and does not pretend to be anything else.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3352\" data-end=\"3551\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">With <em data-start=\"3357\" data-end=\"3364\">Reach</em>, Paperwhite proves that you do not have to chase the moment to create something lasting. You just have to mean it. These songs do. And they stay with you long after the final note fades.</p>",

Known for her soul-stirring, piano-driven ballads, Avery has amassed over 100 million streams, cementing her place as a voice of raw, relatable storytelling.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"438\" data-end=\"988\">With its minimalist production and hauntingly beautiful vocals, “the boys who don’t know what they want” captures the frustration and vulnerability of navigating almost-relationships—those confusing connections where words and actions never quite align. “The title says it all,” Avery explains. “I wrote this about those situations where someone acts like they want a relationship but won’t commit—or the ones who want it but won’t act on it. It’s not necessarily sad, just a reality we’ve all seen and don’t want to keep experiencing.”</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" data-start=\"438\" data-end=\"988\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7ejsOM6vM20LCgU6vyvYkN?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1242\">A sister-song to her fan-favorite track “you’re just a guy,” this latest release reinforces Avery’s ability to turn life’s everyday heartaches into poetic reflections, striking a chord with listeners who have been in the same emotional limbo.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1244\" data-end=\"1656\">Originally from Pennsylvania, Avery began composing music at just seven years old, with the piano as her storytelling companion. Now based in Los Angeles, her signature sound—delicate yet deeply expressive—remains at the heart of her artistry. Every song starts with Avery at her piano, crafting heartfelt demos that evolve into the lush, melancholic soundscapes fans have come to love.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1658\" data-end=\"2024\">Described as a “happy girl filled with sad songs,” Avery weaves personal experiences, pop culture, and emotional nuance into every lyric. With acclaim from outlets like Just Jared and EARMILK and a growing army of devoted listeners, her recent signing with RECORDS (Sony Music) marks a new era—one that promises even greater heights for this rising star.</p>",
