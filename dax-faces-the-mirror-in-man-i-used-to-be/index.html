Known first as a rapper with relentless delivery and sharp punchlines, he now turns his voice inward, creating a track that feels more like a confessional than a performance. The song is raw, slow-burning, and completely unafraid of silence, allowing space for every word to sink in.</p><p data-start="499" data-end="1020">The heart of the track lies in its honesty. Dax addresses his past struggles with addiction and the regret that still lingers. He does not hide from the damage, nor does he glorify it. Instead, the lyrics read like a letter to his younger self, a direct confrontation with the man who once made choices that threatened to derail everything. The vulnerability here is striking. Hip hop has always made room for confession, but Dax delivers his with a mix of sorrow and resolve that feels different from his earlier work.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="499" data-end="1020"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1v6KfzL3Tw4jt6eYM9l0Fk?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="1022" data-end="1511">What makes <em data-start="1033" data-end="1051">Man I Used To Be</em> stand out is the way it frames change. The song is not just about admitting mistakes. It is about the uncomfortable but necessary act of moving forward without erasing the past. Dax balances grief with gratitude, admitting how far he fell while also pointing to the faith that lifted him back up. His references to God are not heavy-handed, but they are central. They serve as proof that redemption is not an abstract concept for him. It is a lived reality.</p><p data-start="1513" data-end="1864">The production mirrors this shift. Instead of dense beats or flashy arrangements, the track is anchored in soulful textures and a steady rhythm that gives Dax’s voice space to carry the weight of the story. Each line lands with gravity, but there is also a sense of release in the delivery, as if saying these things out loud is part of the healing.</p><p data-start="1866" data-end="2348">The track signals a willingness to step outside the comfort zone of genre and persona, to make music that is not just catchy but necessary. In this way, <em data-start="2074" data-end="2092">Man I Used To Be</em> connects to the lineage of personal confessionals from artists like NF, Logic, and even 2Pac at his most reflective. Beyond rap, it recalls the emotional candor of gospel and the stark storytelling of singer-songwriters who let their pain shape the art.</p><p data-start="2350" data-end="2681">For listeners, the song works as more than autobiography. It becomes a mirror. Anyone who has struggled with self-destruction, regret, or the slow climb toward change will hear echoes of themselves. The track does not offer easy solutions, but it does offer company in the struggle, which is often the most powerful form of hope.</p><p data-start="2683" data-end="3030" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With <em data-start="2688" data-end="2706">Man I Used To Be</em>, Dax proves that growth can sound just as gripping as ambition. It is a reminder that vulnerability, when spoken plainly and set to music, can carry as much force as any verse meant to dominate a stage. This is not the sound of a rapper chasing hits. It is the sound of a man facing himself, and inviting us to listen in.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on August 25, 2025</div><div class="content__footer__col"><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/ana-lunas-slow-burning-confession/" class="invert" rel="prev">Ana Luna’s Slow-Burning Confession</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/anais-and-the-hoops-finds-her-voice-in-growing-pains/" class="invert" rel="next">Anaïs &amp; The Hoops Finds Her Voice in Growing Pains</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="invert" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/redlight-resurfaces-with-homeworks-a-diy-rock-success/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/72/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-16-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/redlight-resurfaces-with-homeworks-a-diy-rock-success/" class="invert">RedLight Resurfaces with &#x27;Homeworks,&#x27; a DIY Rock Success</a></h4><time datetime="2025-10-14T23:43">October 14, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright 2025</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
