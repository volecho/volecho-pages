The music video stars the talented Twinnie in a striking leopard-print romper capture precisely the playfulness and fearlessness of the song. She's a commanding presence-think a world where this songstress is drawing in viewers "into her world of flirtatious fun," according to Daily Mail.<br><br>"Hypothetically" arrived September 20, 2024, and has already garnered rave reviews. As best put by Nashville Socialite, it's an "absolute knockout" of fresh country-pop peppered with a healthy dose of 90s girl-power nostalgia. Twinnie's carefree yet reflective lyrics meander through love, possibilities, and the unspoken "what-ifs," while channeling her trademark warmth and confidence-a mix of strengths and vulnerabilities not unlike those embodied by none other than Shania Twain herself.

Co-written with Reid Sorel and Grace Gunn, "Hypothetically" teases themes from her forthcoming sophomore album, Something We Used To Say, due out on November 8, 2024.<br><br>Off the back of her new album, Twinnie has announced a small, intimate tour of the UK this November, stopping off in London, Brighton, Manchester, York and Glasgow. Her Manchester show has already sold out.</p><p><br>Last year, Twinnie joined the cast of Emmerdale to play Jade, the mean boxing promoter. On her latest role, Twinnie says: "Life has been crazy juggling acting and music, with lots of back and forth between Nashville and Yorkshire, but I'm loving every second of it!<br><br>No stranger to acting, Twinnie has a history on British television with roles in the shows Doctors and Hollyoaks, where she received much acclaim for her portrayal of Porsche McQueen, whose storyline tackled critical social issues like childhood sexual abuse.<br><br>Twinnie became the first British artist to sing the American National Anthem at the stadium of Nashville SC, GEODIS Park, stamping her credentials as a global star with an infectious dynamism.<br><br>Twinnie's life story has been very far from ordinary. At her tender age, she had acted among giants like Glenn Close and Robin Thicke while her West End performances in Chicago and Rock of Ages hinted at the shining star she was to become. Since the launch of her solo career in 2020, she consistently blew minds with her genre-defying sound and continues to inspire, recently performing at AmericanaFest's "Stella + Friends: The Power of Women in Music."</p><p>Hypothetically" is only the beginning of her exciting new chapter.<br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on October 22, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/online-magazine-issue-1/" class="invert" rel="prev">Online Magazine Issue #1</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/new-music-by-vanarin/" class="invert" rel="next">VANARIN’s Mesmerizing New Release: A Taste of Their Upcoming Third Album</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="invert" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/voices-on-the-edge-the-stories-behind-2025s-boldest-sounds/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/100/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-37-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/voices-on-the-edge-the-stories-behind-2025s-boldest-sounds/" class="invert"> Voices on the Edge: The Stories Behind 2025’s Boldest Sounds</a></h4><time datetime="2025-12-02T20:32">December 2, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/emerging-voices-and-bold-sounds-shaping-the-year/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/95/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-33-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/emerging-voices-and-bold-sounds-shaping-the-year/" class="invert">Emerging Voices and Bold Sounds Shaping the Year</a></h4><time datetime="2025-11-24T23:45">November 24, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/ja-lena-releases-bold-new-single-ana-elli-hena/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/34/responsive/volecho-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/ja-lena-releases-bold-new-single-ana-elli-hena/" class="invert">JA Lena Releases Bold New Single “Ana Elli Hena”</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T12:55">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright 2025</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
