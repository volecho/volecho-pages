There is movement in this song, but there is an underlying calm in its core.<br><br>The vocals rest lightly atop this groove, languid and expansive, with production so tactile that it sounds like it was created by human hands. There’s an intimacy to this that evokes nights driving home to skater parties with Jon Bellion or Frank Ocean, with pop production meshing with introspective lyrics. It all adds up to something with a humanity that was created by one pair of hands, not a focus group.<br><br>The quality that sets “COLORS” apart is the lack of overstating the message in the track. This production goes down the line of simplicity and proper warmth: it does not lack the warmth of emotions in favor of the warmth of sound. This composition gives the sense of being produced both for the headphones and the open space.<br><br>If you're a fan of music which blends uplift with reflectiveness, then it fits right in line with current soundtrack-driven tracks or more mellow electronic compositions found on shows such as "Euphoria" or "Atlanta." "COLORS (LETTING GO)" definitely doesn't seek to answer anything. It presents a message that peace will be found by stopping such pursuits.</p><hr><p><strong>Wagner the Band Keep It Loud, Loose, and Human</strong><br><br>Wagner the Band sounds like a band that is simply allergic to polish, and this is exactly what is so good about the music that they make. Their approach to soulful rock music is to inject as much soul as possible, and the music of Daisy and the XTC catalog as a whole captures the essence of a band playing in the same room, and not in a virtual environment. The music is earthy, the guitars are sufficiently chunky, and the vocals of Rainer Wagner have the conviction of a man who means every word that he is saying.<br><br>The record encourages an analog warmth that revels in these imperfections. There are fingers touching strings, air moving around drum kits, and a push and pull that can only exist when musicians are locked together. This is the spirit that exists in early Stones, Faces at their most loose, or deeper cuts from late-60s soul rock, which, more than anything, refused to be tied down to popular opinion.<br><br>In terms of both lyrics and sound, Wagner the Band takes direct aim at the heart. There’s humor, frustration, and passion that’s presented without attitude. It’s music that would be perfect coming off the stage at an underground club or heightening the scene in a bar in a Tarantino movie, where danger and appeal commingle. In a world with hyper-produced audio, the fact that Wagner the Band proves honesty is still the best policy—and the best antidote to edited audio—just goes to show. If you are a person who feels a certain nostalgia for records that smell like the amps they jam on late at night, then XTC is a worthwhile listen.</p><hr><p><strong>Eddy Mann: "Oh Come" - Eddy Mann brings the Christmas spirit back on track with ‘Oh Come</strong><br><br>Eddy Mann has always operated outside the parameters of quantity and showiness, and this Christmas release, “Oh Come,” is no exception. Based on a worship experience at the end of 2024, this song embodies the peace found in a lit room rather than the passion of holiday excitement. Mann holds back on melody, allowing only acoustic guitar and vocal polish to fill the sound. It feels like eavesdropping on a prayer rather than witnessing a show.<br><br>The thing that strikes me, though, is the restraint. Mann avoids building crescendo or dramatic twists, opting to let the familiar melody speak on its own merit. The production here values warmth over sheen, succeeding in creating an intimate atmosphere that evokes the sound of old Rich Mullins recordings, or the calm side of Andrew Peterson’s Christmas discography. It also captures the sense of pause found in classic holiday films such as A Charlie Brown Christmas.<br><br>While Oh Come is easily at home alongside contemporary worship music collections, its use extends off the church property as well. Performed in the dead of night, this is a more introspective work and not a declaration—it is a recognition that Christmas can be quiet as well. Those familiar with Sandra McCracken’s music or the more subdued offerings in the Christmas sets from Sufjan Stevens will discover much to relate to in this work. There is a veritable mountainside of music from Mann’s career to date, but nothing so earthly as this song.<br><br></p><hr><p><strong>Meegan and Tobin Reopen a Holiday Classic With The Seasons Back Again</strong><br><br>The Seasons Back Again, as recorded at Abbey Road Studio 2, was a significant presence when it first surfaced. Its reintroduction is well-timed, less as a nostalgia trip than a reminder that well-crafted songs and genuine voices are well-received no matter how many seasons go by. Jeff Meegan and David Tobin take their time constructing these tracks, incorporating choruses and orchestration without overdoing it. They sound crowded without being crowded.<br><br>There’s a cinematic quality throughout, no surprise given their output in both the world of TV and cinema. The strings swell, the chorales shimmer, and it’s all put together with just enough breathing space. It’s like classic holiday albums from yesteryear, sitting somewhere between Aled Jones’ stuff and the more gentle side of John Barry’s cinematic output. If it’s Love Actually’s emotional tidal pull and classic BBC Christmas specials’ warm hug feel, it’s for you.<br><br>What makes this record last is its sense of home. These songs have a sense of having been written for kitchens and living rooms, not concert stages. Together with their complementary companion piece, "Pretty Swingin' Christmas," this seems almost deliberate, as if the difference is simply that of going from an evening to a family party. Meegan and Tobin get that holiday music must respect its own tradition but cannot get stuck within it. "The Seasons Back Again" is not an attempt at sounding new and modern. It is an attempt at sounding true, and this is where its timelessness lies.<br><br></p><hr><p><strong>RedLight Capture Obsession and Style in A James Bond Complex</strong><br><br>A James Bond Complex is a James Bond Complex, and it is one of RedLights standout tracks even several years down the line. The song has hard-hitting pop couplets that are tempered with a warped sense of tension that reflects its wackiness, its subject matter being a twisted take on that great love. There is a certain swagger, but also a certain awareness. Musically, it derives influence from the angular energy of early Strokes releases and the darker textures of The Cure, with a rhythm that is, nevertheless, contemporary in its vibe. The production is no-frills, preferring rawness and energy as propulsion forward rather than sheen. It is not difficult to see how this track defined what came next in releases like Astronauts LP. Their DIY ethos comes through strongly in the confidence of their musical approach. They have a reliance on riffs and repetition that sounds very organic, very DIY, but leaves nothing to be desired as far as hooks are concerned.<br>Listening to the song belatedly, it does not seem like the sort of track that could not have been included on a contemporary indie rock playlist, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Interpol or early Arctic Monkeys releases.<br>Those who enjoy cool, stylish thrillers like Drive or the more traditional James Bond offerings will enjoy this added element of flair too, which the band brings as it looks to the future with new releases. A James Bond Complex provokes the memory that good ideas, done well, never truly die away.</p><hr><p><strong>DPB Combines Faith and Groove in *The Wonders of Christmas*</strong><br><br>The Wonders of Christmas is a reflection of DPB at his most accessible. This song brings a vintage doo-wop vibe, has a harmonious and uplifting chorus, and a beat that beckons you to move along. With Journey Eiland and Ouiwey Collins, this song brings a message that doesn’t fall flat but also manages not to be too preachy.<br><br>In production terms, DPB maintains a clean and playful approach, relying on bass lines and hand claps to bring warmth to this sound. There definitely appears to be an element of classic holiday soul here, but enough of this sound exists to bring this to contemporary faith music. The related animated feature illustrates an extension of this same feel, continuing to promote hope and concern without extreme context.<br><br>The legacy of hip-hop and ministry that DPBs voice carries can be heard throughout its natural ability to combine genres and audiences. And this particular song could easily be right at home amongst Kirk Franklins holiday recordings or even some of the more lighthearted moments found within some of Chance the Rapper’s gospel-infused tracks. But it also shares a quality within some family-friendly movies like Jingle Jangle, where color and meaning come together without any burden.<br><br></p><hr><p><strong>Bluuwav and Ben Provencial - Find Calm Motion in New Collaborations</strong><br><br>Bluuwavs’ collaboration with Ben Provencial swells quietly into the body, with chord progressions, house beats, and vocals that have an intimate, not-performed feel. The track is more focused on flow than build, with enough repetition to provide comfort through melodic ideas. It’s designed to play in cars at night or in dark listening environments.<br><br>Cameron Taylor’s producer credits are evident through the clear mixing job that has given all elements space, right down to the low end pulse and the airy vocal elements. There is depth to this music, but there is no attempt to force its presence. Fans of Shallou, Oskar Med K, or even Tycho’s more contemplative work ought to be right at home here. The tracks also mirror the broader career path taken by Bluuwavs—a career founded upon a love for collaboration and a willingness to let time pass. Forget the sync and pop credibility—this record feels like a personal statement. It’s a nod to the visuals found in movies like Lost in Translation, where atmosphere is the narrative thrust. Instead of striving for heights, the record maintains a steady course through a reliance on nuances.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 29, 2025</div><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/jd-hinton-cements-the-missing-moment-is-a-masterful-example-of-a-missed-opportunity-turned/" class="inverse" rel="prev">JD Hinton Cement’s “The Missing Moment” is a masterful example of a missed opportunity turned</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/songs-that-feel-lived-in-not-polished-away/" class="inverse" rel="next">Songs That Feel Lived In, Not Polished Away</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="inverse" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/dizzy-panda-blur-the-human-line-with-a-nervy-late-night-album-that-refuses-easy-answers/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/102/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-38-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/dizzy-panda-blur-the-human-line-with-a-nervy-late-night-album-that-refuses-easy-answers/" class="inverse">Dizzy Panda Blur The Human Line With A Nervy, Late Night Album That Refuses Easy Answers</a></h4><time datetime="2025-12-26T01:14">December 26, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/voices-on-the-edge-the-stories-behind-2025s-boldest-sounds/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/100/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-37-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/voices-on-the-edge-the-stories-behind-2025s-boldest-sounds/" class="inverse"> Voices on the Edge: The Stories Behind 2025’s Boldest Sounds</a></h4><time datetime="2025-12-02T20:32">December 2, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/emerging-voices-and-bold-sounds-shaping-the-year/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/95/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-33-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/emerging-voices-and-bold-sounds-shaping-the-year/" class="inverse">Emerging Voices and Bold Sounds Shaping the Year</a></h4><time datetime="2025-11-24T23:45">November 24, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-post"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright 2026</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c3bbc0611ea6a5405014eaca34fe1814"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><div class="cookie-popup js-cookie-popup cookie-popup--uses-badge"><h2>This website uses cookies</h2><p>Select which cookies to opt-in to via the checkboxes below; our website uses cookies to examine site traffic and user activity while on our site, for marketing, and to provide social media functionality. <a href="#not-specified">More details...</a></p><form><input id="gdpr-necessary" name="gdpr-necessary" checked="checked" disabled="disabled" type="checkbox"> <label for="gdpr-necessary">Required</label> <input id="gdpr-functions" name="gdpr-functions" type="checkbox"> <label for="gdpr-functions">Functionality</label> <input id="gdpr-analytics" name="gdpr-analytics" type="checkbox"> <label for="gdpr-analytics">Analytical</label> <input id="gdpr-marketing" name="gdpr-marketing" type="checkbox"> <label for="gdpr-marketing">Marketing</label><p class="cookie-popup__save-wrapper"><button type="submit" class="cookie-popup__save">Save</button></p></form><span class="cookie-popup-label">Cookie Policy</span></div><script>(function() {
