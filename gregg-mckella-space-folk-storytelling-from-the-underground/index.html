With a songwriting history dating back to the early 1980s, McKella has honed a unique voice that lends itself well to small venues and immersive shows. A multi-talented musician, vocalist, and songwriter, he weaves together the clarinet, guitar, glissando guitar, synths, and space FX to deliver shows that fluidly shift from folk, psychedelic blues, alternative indie rock, and the eclectic genre he’s dubbed "space-folk" for years.<br><br>McKella, born in Aylesbury, originally came to prominence with The Presence, touring with the likes of Marillion and Ozric Tentacles. A move to London in 1987 saw him form Image Wot Image with Jeanette Murphy, resulting in extensive touring throughout London, the South East, and festival dates. In 1997, McKella founded Paradise 9 in Brighton, a psychedelia/proto-punk/space rock outfit, becoming a cult staple within the UK underground music scene. Albums such as "Showtime" (1999), "Take Me to the Future" (2013), with Nik Turner and Judge Trev Thoms, and "Science Fiction Reality" (2020), released through Flicknife Records, demonstrate McKella’s talent for incorporating psychedelia with a punk attitude, always with an emphasis on the unexpected.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5oj7C1OgIq2J45YDc2HPBJ?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br><br>Gregg's solo work is infused with a deeply personal sound, born out of years of musical exploration. His first solo album release in December 2025, Songs From the Underground, is a reflection of his time as a street busker in the 1990s and his passion for storytelling. This solo work is the result of production by Martin (Litmus) and is characterized by song-oriented folk music with elements of psychedelia and alternative music, supplemented by the addition of Nick Pynn, Jeanette Murphy, Tyrone Thomas, and Mr Eugene. The addition of violin sections, background vocals, and guitar parts adds depth to the music without muddying the lead vocals by McKella.<br><br>In addition to his own projects, his collaborations are a who’s who of the underground and progressive music scenes, from Nik Turner’s Inner City Unit to Mick Farren &amp; The Portobello Allstars, and from Spirits Burning &amp; Michael Moorcock to his associations with Pink Floyd, Gong, Hawkwind, and Blue Öyster Cult. He is, of course, a core player of the Daevid Allen Glissando Guitar Orchestra, where he employs the legendary seven drone method, a reflection of his skill and his willingness to push the boundaries of sonic exploration.<br><br>Regardless of whether McKella is performing alone or as a collaboration, his shows are marked by warmth and creativity. McKella’s music is best suited for an intimate setting or alternative festivals and arts spaces. Every note and every lyric is infused with a lifetime of underground music. This is an extraordinary offering for listeners, as it brings them history as well as an immediate connection.<br><br>Gregg McKella is more than a performer; he is a subculture original whose work demands listening. For those looking for something different, his performances offer the possibility of engagement, thought, and the excitement of music that is at once timeless and unique. Book Gregg McKella today and give your audience the benefit of his decades of underground knowledge and experimental ideas combined with the warmth of storytelling.</p><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://volecho.com/tags/articles/">Articles</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"><div class="related"><h2 class="related__title">Related posts:</h2><ul class="related__items"><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/budget-guitars/">From Garage to Studio: Best Budget-Friendly Guitars for Musicians</a></h3></li></ul></div><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
