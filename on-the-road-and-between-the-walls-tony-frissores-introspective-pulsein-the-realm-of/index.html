Released in 2025 as the last installment of a seven-track set recorded on the road, Four Walls represents a moment of solitude—a feeling of being on the move but alone in your own company. It is a contemplative song but not a sad one, and it maintains its rhythmic pulse even as it explores intimacy.<br><br>As an artist, producer, and long-time aficionado of the genre, Tony’s own personal history is as diverse as the music he creates. From Boston to the jazz scene of New Orleans, and then on to the clubs of the European mainland to network with other DJs and nightclub owners, Tony’s global perspective is reflected in the diverse rhythms and elements of the many styles of music he weaves into his own works. Today, Tony is currently performing as the frontman for the Cleveland-based group Pop Avenue while pursuing his own solo career as an artist.<br><br>Four Walls is at a calmer crossroads of his sound. While tracks such as Just Fade Away and The Eagle Has Landed reach out with energetic urgency and directness, Four Walls looks inward, celebrating the feelings of being enclosed both physically and emotionally. This is a track whose production is full of the dynamics of both motion and stasis at the same time, with delicate electronics underscoring quiet reflection and fleeting memories in the midst of the rush of traveling. It's a track that is very filmic, like the view of the city through the window of a hotel room at night.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/09qTJTEgJU2ivPZhvPjZvD?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>Frissore’s work has international reach. His songs have been featured on MTV, Discovery, TLC, HGTV, OWN, and the DIY Network, and Shazammed in more than 150 countries, which shows a rare talent for speaking to everyone while still having a unique voice. *Four Walls*, on the other hand, is a very personal work. It shows a producer with the talent to create both public and private spaces.<br><br>This single is a product of his very productive 2025, in which he produced singles such as Know Yourself, Stand for Freedom, Self Soothe, and Bad Strategies. Through all of these, he is able to shift easily from one genre to another, whether it is EDM, hip-hop, or even the more contemplative down-tempo genre, with years of experience under his belt, from his earlier work in 2008 with The Übermix to his Quarantine Chronicles in 2020. However, Four Walls is unique in its simplicity and emotional depth.<br><br>Listeners familiar with Frissore’s discography will know his unique combination of groove, texture, and melody. Newcomers to his music will find a song that is both intimate and sophisticated, a song that is reflective while also having enough rhythmic propulsion to recall that it is music written by someone who understands the road, both physically and figuratively. "Four Walls" is a subtle gem in a vast discography. It is a reminder that in the midst of movement, sound, and the global, it is important to look inward, to observe, to listen, and to create a space where the world recedes and all that is left is the sound and the mind.<p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on January 19, 2026</p><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="inverse" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3><p><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://volecho.com/a-moment-of-reverence-eddy-manns-oh-come-brings-fresh-warmth-to-a-timeless-carol/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/121/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-50-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5">A Moment of Reverence: Eddy Mann’s “Oh Come” Brings Fresh Warmth to a Timeless Carol</h3></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://volecho.com/entre-tes-mains-antonio-david-bridges-emotion-and-innovation/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="content__nav__text">Next Post<h3 class="h5">Entre Tes Mains: Antonio David Bridges Emotion and Innovation</h3></div><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/123/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-52-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/whiskey-ghosts-and-the-long-road-home/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/120/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-49-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/whiskey-ghosts-and-the-long-road-home/" class="inverse">Whiskey, Ghosts, and the Long Road Home</a></h4><time datetime="2026-01-17T13:06">January 17, 2026</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__newsletter newsletter"><p class="newsletter__note">Get the latest QF news, updates and more delivered<br>directly to your email inbox</p><form>...</form></div><a class="logo" href="https://volecho.com/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/website/transparent-Photoroom-2.png" alt="volecho.com" width="400" height="400"></a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Volecho 2026</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
