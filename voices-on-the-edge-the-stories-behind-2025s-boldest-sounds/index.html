Bardo Blues marks one of their sharper returns-a track that might rattle a pub window while it simultaneously pulls you into its trance. It lands with snarling guitars, a rhythm section that stays tight even when everything else swings wild, Kim Le Tan's voice shifting from velvet to venom without warning.<br><br>The band's history has always been a little chaotic. Forming in 2015, they'd release cult favorites like Popular Demand and the brilliantly blunt Brexit Chainstore Massacre. Then their drummer vanished and everything paused. Their 2023 re-arrival with a refreshed lineup feels a bit like the start of a new chapter in some sort of punk comic book. The energy remains unfiltered, but the focus is keener. Imagine early Stooges attitude with flickering glimpses of wiry guitar lines from Television or maybe that one crooked groove you'd find yourself falling into on some Cramps deep cut.<br><br>Bardo Blues carries that crooked grin, rolling out like the soundtrack to a lost David Lynch bar scene. It packs the mood of bands like Fat White Family and Goat Girl but with more shadow and a little more swagger. The Widows thrive in that space between control and chaos, where a song might veer off the tracks only to slam back into place on the next beat. If you like films where the neon flickers and something strange hums in the background, or records that feel like they were taped in a room with too much smoke and not enough sleep, this is well worth your time. Put on Bardo Blues, then go back to their older work and let the whole thing wash over you. It hits like a late night walk through Camden when you're not quite sure if you should be thrilled or worried. Either way, it keeps you looking over your shoulder.</p><hr><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]" dir="auto" tabindex="-1" data-turn-id="ee87fbf2-fc47-4735-8025-def29ce50b82" data-testid="conversation-turn-72" data-scroll-anchor="false" data-turn="assistant"><div class="text-base my-auto mx-auto [--thread-content-margin:--spacing(4)] thread-sm:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(6)] thread-lg:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(16)] px-(--thread-content-margin)"><div class="[--thread-content-max-width:40rem] thread-lg:[--thread-content-max-width:48rem] mx-auto max-w-(--thread-content-max-width) flex-1 group/turn-messages focus-visible:outline-hidden relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn" tabindex="-1"><div class="flex max-w-full flex-col grow"><div class="min-h-8 text-message relative flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 text-start break-words whitespace-normal [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-1" dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="ee87fbf2-fc47-4735-8025-def29ce50b82" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1"><div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[1px]"><div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full break-words dark markdown-new-styling"><p data-start="0" data-end="46"><strong>Judith Owen Swings Back Into the Spotlight</strong><br><br>Judith Owen approaches music with the kind of spark that makes you lean in, and her return with Judith Owen Swings Christmas feels both like a warm reunion and a reminder of how much character she brings to jazz. The Wales-born, New Orleans-based singer has long balanced sharp humor with emotional depth, and her holiday record captures that mix with a glow that suits winter nights. Her phrasing has that sly charm you hear in old Rosemary Clooney cuts, but the production carries a tight modern snap. It's the sort of album you put on while cooking late, the kind that pairs nicely with a rewatch of The Holiday or even the cozy chaos of classic Nora Ephron films.<br><br>Owen is working toward a new full-length in early 2026, and the excitement building makes perfect sense. Come On and Get It, her tribute to the fierce women of the forties and fifties, earned wide praise for good reason: She approached those songs with affection but also a fresh sense of character-the way Amy Winehouse once reshaped the past without straining for effect. Underneath it all sits a personal story marked by early loss, years of uncertainty, and a steady push toward joy. She's spoken publicly about anxiety and depression, and that honesty gives her work a grounded tone that keeps sentiment from turning sugary.<br><br>Her collaboration with David Torkanowsky and a circle of New Orleans players keeps the arrangements lively without losing focus. Owen shines brightest when she leans into the cool swing of the band, riding the rhythm the way Julie London once did, half whisper and half wink. It's easy to imagine fans of Madeleine Peyroux or Chet Baker drifting toward her catalogue, or even listeners who lean toward intimate film soundtracks like In the Mood for Love.<br><br>What really makes this phase of her career striking is how self-assured she sounds. There's humor, there's fire, and the sense of someone fully at ease with her quirks and instincts. With Helen Mirren and Jennifer Coolidge among her cheering section of admirers, she has that energy of the artist not trying to impress anyone but simply to tell stories with clarity and heart. Her next chapter is set up to be one of her strongest yet, and if the new album expands on this spirit, then fans of classic jazz vocals are in for a treat.</p><hr><p data-start="0" data-end="46"><strong>Paul Louis Villani Breaks the Floorboards With Sound That Leaves a Mark</strong><br><br>Paul Louis Villani is not here to make background music. His new work hits with the force of something restless and sharp-the kind of sound that cuts through whatever you were thinking about a moment before. The Melbourne producer has always moved across styles, pulling from funk, metal, hip hop, and art rock-yet he treats each influence like raw clay. Nothing feels neat. Nothing feels gentle. His track Quit Bleeding All Over the Floor is a good entry point. It rolls forward with bass that lands like a warning and vocals which press close without apology. A Spotify link is out there for anyone brave enough to jump in. The forthcoming record Fully Unchained Creativity, Kinetically Overriding Fossilised Frameworks, due November 2025, pushes this mood even harder. It sounds like someone tearing down a room in the dark just to see what might take shape next. If you're into Death Grips, early Nine Inch Nails, or the rougher edges of Sleaford Mods, there'll be something for you here to chew on. Any gloss gets stripped away by the video that sits with the single. Bodies twitch and twist across the frame, all nerves and sharp angles, like a dance piece inspired by a panic attack scene from Black Swan. No plot, no soft landing, just motion driven by tension. Villani treats sound like a living creature with teeth, and it's precisely that which makes his work so compelling. It reminds you that the music can still provoke if the artist is willing to risk discomfort. This is not safe listening. It is far more interesting than that.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="z-0 flex min-h-[46px] justify-start"><hr></div></div></div></article><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-(--header-height)" dir="auto" tabindex="-1" data-turn-id="3f1f9ec1-ac71-4e82-bb35-84193dc1a5a9" data-testid="conversation-turn-73" data-scroll-anchor="false" data-turn="user"><p data-start="0" data-end="94"> </p><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]" dir="auto" tabindex="-1" data-turn-id="a4582de6-6e94-4a7a-8c80-73e9b644bcbc" data-testid="conversation-turn-78" data-scroll-anchor="false" data-turn="assistant"><div class="text-base my-auto mx-auto [--thread-content-margin:--spacing(4)] thread-sm:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(6)] thread-lg:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(16)] px-(--thread-content-margin)"><div class="[--thread-content-max-width:40rem] thread-lg:[--thread-content-max-width:48rem] mx-auto max-w-(--thread-content-max-width) flex-1 group/turn-messages focus-visible:outline-hidden relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn" tabindex="-1"><div class="z-0 flex min-h-[46px] justify-start"><p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong data-start="204" data-end="277">JD Days Bring Heart, Humor, and Big-Screen Warmth to the Holidays with 'Christmas Anthology'<br></strong><br>JD Days get into the festive spirit with the Christmas Anthology, a record that feels like someone took the classic Christmas album format, fed it through a storyteller's mind, and tied the whole thing together with the glow of a winter cinema trip. The UK collective, led by singer-songwriter James, mix pop-rock, folk, and clean melodic writing with short 3D animated films for every track. It gives the project the spirit of an old-school holiday movie night, the sentimental kind that sits somewhere between early Pixar, The Snowman, and the rom-com charm of something like Serendipity.<br><br>Across the ten tracks, the group move through snowy New York streets, a loud-and-loose rock tune about Santa in full reckless mode, and softer songs that sit closer to candlelight. Six originals hold the emotional weight and four familiar classics are rebuilt with a light touch. It never tips into sugar overload. Instead it works like a series of small stories about forgiveness and second chances, the sort of themes that power everything from It's A Wonderful Life to the quieter moments in modern Christmas films like Klaus.<br><br>JD Days writes with a sincerity that sounds rare in seasonal music. There's warmth, but there's an understanding, too, that winter brings with it its own heaviness. James said that the aim was to make work that can light the dark, and that tone carries through every track. The arrangements lean on clear acoustic textures, lifting choruses, small bursts of choral color, and enough pop bite to keep each song from drifting into background cheer. The animation adds another layer. Nothing fancy for the sake of it, just stories that pair well with the music. Think of the way Gorillaz use visuals to deepen a song, but swap the surreal edge for something gentler and more festive.<br><br>For listeners who enjoy the heartfelt tone of She &amp; Him's holiday records, the warmth of Taylor Swift's Christmas Tree Farm, or even the nostalgic tug of old Specials like The Muppet Christmas Carol, there's an easy entry point here. At its best, Christmas Anthology plays like a gentle reminder that seasonal music needn't be disposable: it can be tender without being soft, bright without turning brittle, and playful without losing its point.<br><br>More than anything, this release treats Christmas as a time when people try again. Songs move through love, regret, small triumphs, and the hope the season can mend what the year has strained. It is a record made with care, built on simple human themes rather than heavy gloss. JD Days offer something warm enough for a long car ride home, steady enough for late-night wrapping sessions, and rich enough for anyone who still wants holiday music to mean something.<strong data-start="204" data-end="277"><br><br></strong></p><hr><p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong data-start="204" data-end="277">KTLM Creates Noise the Algorithms Can't Touch<br><br></strong>KTLМ is the kind of project that feels born from a late-night group chat gone rogue, then somehow turned into a full-scale art attack. This Russian-speaking collective pushes anti-war messages through satire, glitchy visuals, and sound jumping styles as if trying to outrun the Internet itself: punk, folk, rap, noise, cartoon chaos-whatever works. The point is to keep the listener awake, not comfy. In a digital world shaped by metrics and engineered attention spans, they stand out for breaking every rule and doing it with a grin.<br><br>The group clues into something many artists whisper about but few address: how algorithms flatten everything they touch. KTLM fights back with content that refuses to sit still. A track might kick off like a Soviet punk bootleg before spinning into a beat that hints at early Gorillaz or the oddball charm of Daniel Johnston animations. Their characters pop up like NPCs from some fever-dream video game, all pushing the same idea that war and propaganda turn people into spectators when they should be calling the whole thing out.<br><br>What makes KTLM interesting is the streak of real heart running underneath all the chaos: you hear flashes of longing in the folk melodies and flashes of rage in the noise breaks. It's a mix that recalls the sharp wink of Monty Python, the rough edges of Pussy Riot, and the surreal punch of Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's messy in the right way. The live show, currently in development, promises the same unruly mood. Imagine a gig that leaps between theatre, protest, and late-night cable weirdness, each one delivered from a cast of artists who want to snap you out of the lull of passive scrolling. It may confuse a few people, and that's part of the charm. KTLM may never sit high on an algorithmic chart, but that's the point. They work for the humans still paying attention, the ones who want art that actually says something. In a world where so much feels flattened, their noise feels like a genuine refusal to make peace with the norm.</p><hr><p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong>A Light In Motion: Eternal Tone Pushes Through The Static With Kodaks</strong><br><br>Eternal Tone's music is like an attempt to keep the flame alive in strong winds, and that comes across readily on Kodaks. The Kansas artist pulls Hip Hop, Rap, and RnB into a smooth, melodic swing that never feels rushed. The hook lands with a slow burn, the verses feel lived in, and the beat settles into a warm, late-night pulse that recalls the patience of early Chance tapes or the reflective side of Saba. There's quiet confidence to the way the track builds, a sense that Tone knows the weight of every line before it leaves his chest.<br><br>What gives Kodaks its pull is the grounding force behind it. The song isn't out to posture; it's closer to the mix of faith and grit you hear in artists who grew up with both struggle and hope in the same room. Tone sings and raps like someone who has spent long nights sorting through old memories, then decided to turn them into something that carries light. There's a bit of Cudi's raw heart, a touch of Khalid's softness, and the Midwest's steady calm shaping the edges.<br><br>Listeners who lean toward the warmth of Giveon or the reflective glow of Isaiah Rashad will find something familiar here, but Kodaks never feels like it is tracing anyone else's lines. Tone gives the track a mood that feels wide open, like the final shot of a film where the camera pulls back over a quiet town and you're left with the sense that someone inside one of those houses just chose a different path.<br><br>If you stack it next to films like Moonlight or The Pursuit of Happyness, it shares that same sense of flickering strength-the subtle kind that grows in silence and then hits when the moment lands. One writes from that space: hard days, wrong turns, small victories, small losses, and a stubborn belief that all these can shape something better.<br><br>Beyond the single, Eternal Tone frames his whole catalog as a place where people can rest for a minute. He talks openly about wanting his work to feel like a small refuge, and you hear that in the soft production touches and the way his voice breaks slightly at the edges. He isn't offering perfection, just honesty. That is often far harder to find.<br><br>Kodaks feels like a marker in the story of an artist who isn't in any hurry, building piece by piece, as Midwest creators do. There's room here for anyone who likes their music steady, heartfelt, and free from noise. It's the kind of track you play when driving nowhere on purpose, or when the day has been too much and you need someone to tell the truth without raising their voice.<br><br>Eternal Tone may still be rising, but Kodaks shows he already knows how to turn his past into fuel. The song glows with quiet intention, and if his future work stays this tuned in, it won't be long before his name sits next to artists who shaped him. For now, Kodaks stands on its own as a reminder that sound hits hardest when it comes from a place that's still learning, still growing, still trying, and still shining through the static.<br><br></p><hr><p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong>Jax Fleming finds his voice in raw, late-night tangles of memory and noise.</strong><br><br>Jax Fleming's debut EP, I'll Be Fine, lands like a quiet confession pushed through an amp turned just past safe. The six tracks feel close to the skin, built from moments he lived-not ones he staged. You can hear the hands behind it too, since he played nearly everything himself. That choice gives the whole record a warm, rough edge, the kind you get from someone figuring things out in real time and refusing to polish the truth out of it.<br><br>Raised outside Henderson, Kentucky, Jax chased something bigger from the moment a grainy festival video of 30 Seconds to Mars lit a spark in him. He carried that fire through his years fronting Atlas of the Dogs, playing big rooms around southern Indiana, before shaving off the frontman gloss and stepping into something closer to the kid he was. The slacker 90s clothes, the honest mess, the way the songs fall between grunge, indie, and heartache, all of it fits. HiLo, the lead track from the EP, twists between two moods: one minute loose and breezy, with a soft rock sway; the next, it kicks into a sharper guitar run that hits harder with each listen. It sounds like someone being pulled along by a love they can’t quite hold steady, which makes it easy to line up next to coming-of-age films like Perks of Being a Wallflower or the early scenes of Almost Famous. Macie pulls from that same part of his heart, tying teenage memories to the present in ways that never feel forced. Accordingly, fans of Dayglow, early Cage the Elephant, or even the softer side of Smashing Pumpkins will find much to hang onto here. The EP plays like a season of someone's life-the late night parts, at any rate. Jax and producer Wes Luttrell built something that sits between regret and relief, that place where you take a breath and tell yourself it's fine, even when you're not sure yet. And somehow, that honesty hits harder than anything louder could.</p><hr></div></div></div></article><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-(--header-height)" dir="auto" tabindex="-1" data-turn-id="7780fbbe-f5e9-499e-b14e-751132f2d092" data-testid="conversation-turn-79" data-scroll-anchor="false" data-turn="user"><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]" dir="auto" tabindex="-1" data-turn-id="request-68e0f597-2f90-832f-88b4-28c59798b36f-0" data-testid="conversation-turn-86" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-turn="assistant"><div class="text-base my-auto mx-auto pb-10 [--thread-content-margin:--spacing(4)] thread-sm:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(6)] thread-lg:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(16)] px-(--thread-content-margin)"><div class="[--thread-content-max-width:40rem] thread-lg:[--thread-content-max-width:48rem] mx-auto max-w-(--thread-content-max-width) flex-1 group/turn-messages focus-visible:outline-hidden relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn" tabindex="-1"><div class="flex max-w-full flex-col grow"><div class="min-h-8 text-message relative flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 text-start break-words whitespace-normal [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-1" dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="2be59af2-c39c-4c5b-859b-5bfe32cc6bef" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1"><div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[1px]"><div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full break-words dark markdown-new-styling"><p data-start="0" data-end="78" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><strong data-start="0" data-end="78" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Michellar Finds Her Fire Again In A Quiet Storm Of Folk Memory And Renewal</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article><p class="sr-only"><br>Michellar's new album feels like a long breath finally released. REVERIE .FROM THEN TILL NOW carries the weight of years spent quiet, only to return with songs that glow like porch lights on a late summer night. You can hear the imprint of her early influences in the songwriting craft, the gentle sway of James Taylor, the steady warmth of Carole King, the folk calm of Peter Paul and Mary. But the record never sounds stuck in memory. Instead, it plays like someone stepping back into the room with a clear voice and a sharper sense of what matters.<br><br>Raised in a music-soaked home and later rooted in the San Francisco scene, Michellar wrote her first songs at fifteen, then put the guitar down for four decades while she built a life in landscape design. The spark hit again in 2023, when one acceptance letter from the deYoung Museum quietly rearranged everything. Since then, she has written at a pace that feels almost instinctive: dropping more than twenty singles in nine months, shaping a full album that holds tight to both quiet reflection and a renewed drive.<br><br>The songs on REVERIE move with steady confidence, guided by soft acoustic textures and lyrics that feel honest rather than polished. There's no attempt to hide the years she spent growing outside of music. If anything, those years deepen the record, giving it the tone of someone who knows how it feels to return to an old love and recognize its pull instantly. It pairs well with records like Joni Mitchell's Blue and Aimee Mann's Lost in Space or even the quieter moments of Boygenius, where simple lines land with surprising clarity.<br><br>The knowing calm of Michellar's writing echoes an intent behind every word, birthed from life lived.
