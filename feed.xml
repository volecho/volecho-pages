This stripped-back rendition evokes the serenity of a quiet seaside afternoon, the very setting in which the song was originally conceived.</p>

<p data-start="364" data-end="718">Somber, soft, and deeply heartfelt, the track invites listeners into a moment of stillness and introspection. Its structure mirrors the ebb and flow of the ocean, weaving together real field recordings from Nova Scotia’s Minas Basin, waves, wind, and distant breaths, to create an intimate soundscape that blurs the line between music and meditation.</p>
<p data-start="720" data-end="1022" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Written during a reflective afternoon spent by the water, <em data-start="778" data-end="800">“Breathe (Acoustic)”</em> captures the peaceful rhythm of nature and the simple act of being present. It’s both a sonic painting and a personal meditation, encouraging listeners to find their own seaside moment, take a deep breath, and just <em data-start="1017" data-end="1022" data-is-last-node="">be.</em></p>

                <p>Dontae's Peak sounds like a man walking in the rain with a mic in his left hand and a mirror in his right. Born Dontaé Jareel Pelzer in Mount Vernon and residing in Poughkeepsie, he's over a decade into creating a voice that refuses to remain static. His songs occupy a place between Hip, Hop and R&amp;B, but the reason he is different is that his songs have this cinematic feel to them, like novel chapters where the hero doesn't know whether he's ascending or falling apart. There is this duplicity that runs: light and darkness, hope wrapped in burden, victory haunted by sorrow.<br><br>His musical roots date back to the early 2000s, when Paramore's desperation and mushy choruses met the emotional candor of his mother's 90s R&amp;B mixtapes. That integration of brash and melodic carries over to his delivery, half confession, half breath. During his adolescence, he had a creative foil in Calvin "Cal" McCants, whose partnership was more about loose co-conspiracy than loose co-collaboration. As his old nickname Jay Jefe, he transitioned between recording rooms within Atlantic Records NYC, exchanged sound concepts with producers such as Bizness Boi and Wondagurl, and added conceptual richness to venues such as Blackthorn 51 and Amityville Music Hall.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6BCLzhXliBSPXxuA5N84Zv?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>His BLKLITE work was similar to the psychological descent narrative sequence in a movie where neon glows above broken reflections, calling forth self, trauma, and psychical health, discovery through darkness, film production by David Sisko and DanielOnTheTrack. It wasn't about lingering; it was about confronting your demons in ultraviolet truth. Now, as Dontae's Peak, he has transitioned into a more polished clarity. The narration is keener, the sense more pointed, the vision unwritten.<br><br>"Karma," out on October 24, 2025, is the first indication of a multi, year arc through 2027, the start of a comeback and not a remake. This isn't coming back. It's coming. Dontae's Peak is situated midway between where he'd been and where he's going, and it reminds all of us that pain leaves fingerprints for a purpose: not to have us stamped as broken, but to show that every scar is part of the climb.</p>

<p>There is something basically addictive about music that seems to have been stashed away in this universe from some other parallel one. Stray Planets, the Dublin psych, pop cult band of songwriters John Butler, have been operating for years in that place where pop hooks dissolve into daydreamed hallucinations and the distinctions between nostalgia and unreality become deliquescled. With his latest EP Are You Real, Cristobal Leedy? Slipping November 7, Butler is not concerned with creating something tidy or cool, aligned and more devoted to trying to nail the psychic buzz of a world in which even your sense of self is brokered by code. </p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6PDwiIKWQuF6OWatYcAS93?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>It's not an easy record in the traditional sense but it's richly rewarding in much the same way that a perfectly askew film lingers with you after the credits. This EP is not so much a return or a rebirth as it is an adolescence in a psychedelic terrarium that Butler never let evaporate. He has always had the presence of an underground legend who works to his own tempo, a cousin of Vinyl Williams or a mystical neighbor of Jacco Gardner. It still has that fuzzy aura you'd expect from, like, old Elephant 6 cassettes or similarly distorted '60s pop that sounds like it's been conjured up on some long-lost reel in a thrift store and re-mastered at just barely the right speed. But it all comes together here.<br><br>It is braver, more skewed, more there with never losing the logic of a dream. The EP starts with Your Revolution, a shoegaze-slated reflection full of laces, which is centered around the theme that even if artificial intelligence is as efficient as it is, it can't defeat a human just because it doesn't hurt. It is a concept that reads heavy on paper, but Butler lightens it up and makes it airy in a manner that doesn't make it any less real. If OK Computer had been penned after a session of binge, viewing TikTok deepfakes at 3 am, it would probably go a bit like this.<br><br>The guitars undulate in and out of space, and the vocals glide like a transmission lodged halfway between two frequencies. Lead single Hallucinations is the clear starting point, featuring guest vocals from Gilla Band's Dara Kiely. Kiely's vocal delivery is like he is describing the emotional breakdown of someone witnessing his face distort into something incomprehensible on a glitching AI screen. The tune has that Technicolor craziness of early Flaming Lips or that manic theatrics of The Coral at their more deranged best. It is demented, spinning, and nonsensical in a way that is completely calculated.<br><br>You can literally sense the ground spinning beneath your feet. And then there is the transient interlude Cristobal Leedy, named after a mysterious YouTube commenter who long ago referred to Stray Planets' music as "truly astonishing." Butler doesn't view it as flattery but as a metaphysical bug. He retorts with a question: Are you real? And if they are, then what am I?<br><br>In under a minute, he conveys something that rings true for anyone who has ever bared their soul in art and heard it reverberate back through a comment chain that might or might not have been penned by an actual human being.<br><br>Salvia languishes as a fevered flashback. Born of mid, to, late 2000s Capel Street, it's the missing scene from a movie between Enter The Void and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind where the hero realizes that they might never wake up. It's both city and ethereal-sounding, the sort of song you can't help but imagine when you think of neon, rainy streets and the odd euphoria of being free from time. The nearer Artificial Love brings the entire enterprise into bittersweet relief. It's four minutes of searing arpeggios and glassy psych, pop that would not sound out of place alongside a song by Tame Impala or Temples, but the emotional center is stranger and heavier. Butler sings as someone who has come to the realisation that love from a machine is preferable to none. The concept is ridiculous, pathetic, and eerily familiar during the time of parasocial relationships, AI companions, and artificial digital personas which are all now included in how humans deal with loneliness. The song isn't cynical, however. It's like a guy dancing with a phantom that he knows doesn't exist but dancing anyway. It is what makes this EP package more interesting than so much contemporary psych, pop that Butler isn't trying to impress anyone. It's like something that he created because he had to. That surrealism tension and sincerity places it in dialogue with other albums that hover just above the borders of mainstream pop storytelling, such as Broadcast's Haha Sound, Pond's The Weather, or even portions of King Gizzard's more pop-heavy discography. There is also a sense of self-consciously playful humor here that is more reminiscent of Terry Gilliam films or the off-kilter cartoon causality of early Adult Swim bumpers.</p>

<p>Karen Salicath Jamali’s new piano single, Mary’s Blessing, arrives like a gentle dawn, a piece of music that feels as much like a meditation as a performance. The composition was born in a dream, and that dreamlike quality carries through every note. Early one morning, she recorded it on her Steinway piano, translating the delicate rhythms of memory and imagination into sound. There is a subdued quietude here, the feeling of being watched by the presence, a rose petal of light curling inward with every chord. The music is simple but profound, a recalling of the truth that exists in clarity and the heart's honesty. For Jamali, music has always been but an extension of inner transformation. A near-death experience in 2012 altered everything. After a head injury and three-year convalescence, she began writing and playing the piano spontaneously without ever having learned the piano properly. This happy accident uncovered a talent which has produced more than 2,500 pieces and eight complete albums, and taken her on stage at Carnegie Hall eight times. The experience left her with a profound sense of achieving sound as a unitive tissue, a bond between human existence and the rhythms of the cosmos. Mary's Blessing is a concentrated expression of that achievement: a piece that attempts to heal and soothe without uttering a sound. The single was mastered by Maria Triana, a veteran engineer whose career spans decades at Sony Music and includes collaborations with artists from Aretha Franklin and Miles Davis to Camila Cabello and Britney Spears. Triana’s precision ensures that Jamali’s delicate piano lines and subtle dynamic shifts are fully realized, giving the listener a sense of space and resonance. Jamali’s compositions often draw on spiritual and angelic themes, and Mary’s Blessing is no exception. The music emerges from a vision of protection and love, reflecting a sense of presence and guidance, like a quiet force looking over the listener. It recalls the meditative clarity of Ludovico Einaudi or the emotive, minimalist textures of Max Richter, while maintaining a distinct voice rooted in her own journey. There is also an implied filmic quality, a feeling of frozen time as in scenes from A Ghost Story or The Tree of Life, in which the affect lingers as heavily as any story.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4p7vUm7FVaSl7DSBf1X0QS?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>Her tale is not just outstanding for its artistry, but for the manner in which music was a process of survival and of recovery. The crash that necessitated her becoming a musician also redefined her understanding of consciousness and connection. Jamali often speaks about sound as an all-inclusive language that unites humans with each other, with nature, and with the cosmos. Listening to Mary's Blessing, it's easy to feel that philosophy in the music, each note a gentle reminder of oneness. For those interested in delving into comparable territories in modern piano music, her work would easily find itself alongside contemplative, storytelling musicians like Ólafur Arnalds and Nils Frahm, or even more spiritually focused ventures like Enya's ambient piano-centered pieces. Her music, though, still holds an individuality born out of living, that authenticity derived from the presence of creation—the reality that this music directly stems from dreams, intuition, and self-transformation.<br><br>Jamali is also celebrated for the manner in which her artistic vision cuts across her media. Decades as a visual artist are followed by paintings and sculptures that hang in more than 700 private collections and museum exhibitions such as the Louvre Museum. Her paintings and music tend to run on themes of energy, light, and surrounding human figures, all concepts that she now engages through music. This two-handed practice gives her playing a somatic sense of shape and space, as if every line for the piano was a brush mark on a larger, unseen canvas. Mary's Blessing is not a piano piece—it is a affirmation of contact, survival, and gentleness. It is the assertion that creativity can be an individual lifeline and a gift to others, a conduit for the transmission of light into the lives of other human beings. Jamali’s work continues to garner recognition, including numerous awards for her albums and compositions, yet the quiet, meditative quality of this single reminds us that her music’s power comes from its honesty and emotional resonance.<br><br>With this album, Karen Salicath Jamali confirms her place among today's composers whose music straddles personal biography, spiritual contemplation, and technical skill. Mary's Blessing is an entreaty to go slowly, to listen, and to feel—something of lightness and serenity in a world that doesn't very often.</p>

<p>There is a lived, in warmth to NEEB's new album Take To The Sky that is newly inspired, music recalling why the band plays music in the first place. The Hartlepool based outfit have been grinding years getting between shapes, dub, drum &amp; bass, house, jazz, but this album is like arrival. Out in October 2025, it's a late-night synthesis of soul, jazz, and ambient funk that has the calm of experience and the urgency of rejuvenation.<br><br>The album puts everything the band have accumulated in twenty years into a way that sounds simple. You can hear it in the bottom groove of "Brighter Day," the effortless glide of "All Caught Up," the percussive push of "Cave of Hands," and the title song's beautiful rise, off. There's space and groove, rhythm and space. Singer and guitarist Jasmine Weatherill's recruitment is a new kind of chemistry to NEEB, the half-crying, half-determined voice of hers, making the band's complicated arrangements human and real. Recorded in their own, self-built Mobeus Studio, Take To The Sky is more of a conversation between musicians who trust one another absolutely. Mark Hand's synth and Rhodes textures provide richly textured underpinnings for the album, precision and swing being delivered by Mark Lloyd on drums. It is Tony Waite's production that holds it all together with a kind of cinematic clarity that never goes over the top.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2qnV9PKoIAHyrbhlSH721i?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p> </p>
<p>On certain tracks, the addition of percussionist Martin Ditcham, a Talk Talk and Sade veteran, brings the extra glow, the feel of the rhythm being performed by someone who understands the restraint that is beauty. It's the type of album that ends up that awkward middle ground between the club and the dimly lit living room. It's for the kids who danced when they were young but now get enjoyment out of a good deep groove and a nice glass. There's an echo of The Cinematic Orchestra, a little of the essence of early Zero 7, and even a few moments that have a touch of Groove Armada's Black Light. But NEEB's sound remains distinctive, based on British jazz funk but with a morose, lethargic slow burn that you feel compelled to keep playing straight through without skipping a beat. This isn't a temporary novelty. NEEB have climbed the hard way. They've toured with Zion Train, Pee, Wee Ellis, Gong, The Egg, and Alabama 3, among others, and played from the Glastonbury Avalon Stage all the way to Solfest and Freerotation. They've been described as "the speccy white boys" in Mixmag with a sympathetic wink, and included on compilations such as Sounds of the Funky Underground, a title which now has to be both a reference to their origins and an account of how they've survived. But Take To The Sky is different. It's bold without swagger, refined without sacrificing the grime. Perhaps it's Weatherill who, upon joining, transitioned NEEB from three-piece to a relaxed and more song-oriented collective. Her voice adds intimacy to the band's rhythmic progression. You feel it in the way her lyrics overlap with keys and percussion — little truths swaddled in a melodic blanket. There's a line in "Brighter Day" where she croons like she's smiling through the mic, and you know this is what hope sounds like when you've labored for it instead of assumed it.<br><br>The album sits well among contemporary UK jazz-soul releases from artists such as Yazmin Lacey, Alfa Mist, and Tom Misch, but NEEB's experience working within electronic music sets them ahead. Under the jazzy chord progressions and ominous basslines, there is always some kind of distant hum of the dancefloor — the echo of a kickdrum, the throb of a night still uncompleted. It's the same genetic material that once fueled their breakbeat and techno adventures, only slowed down and reflective.</p>

<p>Kayla Ramos sings heartbreak and performs it like a climactic event immersed in golden, hour light. Her debut release, "Hard to Say Goodbye," is a cinematic pop ballad which encapsulates the tender moment of holding on versus letting go, where every breath in feels like the edge of something soon to end. With heart-wrenching, emotive vocals and glistening contemporary production by Grammy-nominated producer and composer Dante Lattanzi (Caelum Music Production), the song bursts with raw emotion, telling instantly to those who crave realism over glamour. A welcome addition to sentimental pop playlists, love songs anthologies, and cinematic vocal compilations, but better still, it brings us the artist who will never shy away from feeling it all. Grown up in San Jose and born in California, Ramos was brought up amidst a range of influences—classical recitals, church choirs, musical theater, hip, hop cyphers, jazz improvisational sessions, and early 2000s pop confessionals. She sang even before she could create words into sentences and was already writing songs on piano and guitar at 13, coalescing poetry, philosophy, and lived experience into sounds half-whispered like diary entries. Whether booking tables in neighborhood bars or headlining on stage in theater, Ramos cultivated a voice that could swell with the grandeur of an orchestra one beat and shake with the intimate quiet of a whisper the next.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Her voice now resides in a space where vulnerability is resistance and nostalgia is an act of brash storytelling. Imagine the emotional honesty of Lana Del Rey, the self-searching fervor of Fiona Apple, the lyrical songcraft of Taylor Swift, and the vocal exactness of Ariana Grande, but Kayla is never imitative. Her voice is soft but determined, delicate but not fragile, a glass heart clutched hard in shaking hands. Collaborating with Dante Lattanzi, Ramos has hit the next art heights. "Hard to Say Goodbye" is a page turn, green, unsettling, affectively generous. It's not a debut that screams to be heard; it waits patiently, looping like an unreturned voicemail or the final sentence of a letter you were never supposed to write.Guiding Hard to Say Goodbye, you find yourself wondering if she writes cinematically,  chords ring placed instead of located, as if she is building affective shots. The production never tries too hard. Instead, it gives her voice room to feel human, slightly vulnerable at the edges. Lattanzi’s touch adds modern weight without drowning her sincerity. Fans of artists like Gracie Abrams or early Billie Eilish might recognize the intimacy, while lovers of Ariana Grande’s vocal control will clock Kayla’s quiet strength. But even with those touchpoints, she doesn’t echo anyone too closely. Her gentleness does not apologize. Her holdback is deliberate.<br><br></p>

<p>You can feel it from the initial burst of the drums, the first forceful snip of the guitar, the first gasp before the words come. Monster, their latest single, doesn't waste time, plunging headlong into the battered center of survival. It's raw, taut, and possesses a kind of emotional connection that only derives from having lived through it. Monster is about breaking out of an abusive relationship, getting a balance between vulnerability and hard-won power. The lyrics are like listening to someone whisper their way through the dark, fragile but unflinching. And then there's the chorus, desperate, explosive, yet somehow liberating. You can hear the release in Jelena Petener's voice as it fluctuates from shaking to soaring, a performance that is both exhausted and defiant. Everything dissolves in a fiery controlled blaze by the time the bridge comes around, leaving only the soft whisper of relief. There is something unashamed and retro about Monster that calls to mind how classic rock once shared personal tales with no shame. It blends the emotional openness of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill with the intensity of early Paramore. But JLP's not retro, it's their own language. Funk section makes the rhythm dirty, guitars produce that low, rich, full bodied sound you've got associated with arena floors, and Jelena's singing cuts through the mix like reality cutting through noise. You get the impression this is not a radio-friendly song; it's one fashioned for liberty.</p>
<p class="align-center"> </p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0JpNFDj99Dy1AjIL4FNGvK?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p>JLP formed the way all great bands do — by accident. Luka and Jelena Petener, musical complements and brother and sister in the very best sense, started in an acoustic duo with living room jam sessions. Luka, guitar-strumming fan of ACDC, Guns N' Roses, and Slash, contributed riffs and attitude. Jelena, piano-trained and choir voice, provided melody and dramatic depth. Somewhere in the process on a hot summer evening in Croatia, a jam session took on another form. That spark blossomed into a full band, and before long, they were packing Vienna's clubs, from Szene Wien to the huge Nova Rock Festival, with music that is tidy-sounding but still alive. Strong and Loud We Shout It Out, their motto, is not a T-shirt slogan to be placed upon anyone's chest. It is a credo. Each song has that same rhythm, a blend of grime, happiness, and faith in the reality that music is supposed to move the body and the conscience. JLP's tunes address the world around them: peer pressure, inner conflict, the era we are in. But they never lose their capability for enjoying themselves. You can tell, even when they are worst, that they still have fun. Monster is in the same league. It's a track for anybody who's ever been stuck, anybody who's screamed their way back into themselves.</p>
<p>There's build and release like in a movie, imagine the tension of Black Swan or the emotional fire of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It's music that doesn't cower from darkness but won't be afraid of finding a beat of light there. If you wish to follow JLP's family tree, you might place them alongside acts such as Halestorm, Florence + The Machine, or Nothing But Thieves, bands and artists who live for dynamics, who understand how to turn hurt into something that is commensurate with a triumph. But JLP still sound quintessentially local, based on Vienna's precision-meets-passion hybrid. Their live shows make that even clearer: they work towards perfection, certainly, but never give up the spontaneity that brings rock music to life. It's not perfection; it's authenticity.</p>

<p class="align-center">London's jazz evenings have a knack for unearthing voices that are simultaneously timeless and fresh. In the soft darkness of a Mayfair club, one such voice started turning heads — smoky, smooth, and coolly self-assured. That is Aly Berry, a British singer-songwriter with a jazz-influenced sound whose presence is like a tip of the head towards old-school glamour in contemporary contexts. Her new single, A Matter So Small, is the third from her imminent debut album, and it's a comfortable introduction to her world: equal measures of romance and introspection, all wrapped in late-night velvet.</p>
<p class="align-center"><br><br><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5cKQvzBmGmmwUoUp0ZQYI7?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p class="align-center">From the North of England originally, Aly made the leap that would be her tale. At eighteen, she departed home to London — youthful, driven, and set to make her mark upon two dynamic worlds: music and modeling. She had previously been modeling since a teenager, but the city's creative vibrancy welcomed her on a deeper level. London's jazz scene, with all its grime and glory, was her school room and playground.<br><br>It was where she had her initial encounter with Paul Higgs, an old-time jazz composer and trumpet player with a moviemaking sensibility and intimate familiarity with timeless form. What began as an informal working relationship became a mutually understood language artistically. With him, she started composing and performing, blending her sultry vocals with his rich arrangements. The collaboration became a legitimate recording business — a debut album that sounds like a dialogue between eras, fusing mid-century sophistication from jazz with the integrity of contemporary singer-songwriters. And the titles of the players indicate just how much respect this album commands. Scott Hamilton, if not one of the finest working saxophonists in contemporary jazz today; Dave Green, a bass player with a resume running across decades; Neil Bullock on drums, rhythm genius; and Paul Higgs himself, setting the direction aurally. This isn't an oldies band. This is a collection of players who know feel, and how to tell imitation from magic.<br><br><br>It's subtle, the sort of song where room and silence help to tell part of the story. Aly's voice never insists on being heard above the mix; she yields, she invites, she offers things to think about. There's subtle confidence in her phrasing, you can tell she has listened to the masters, but she's not attempting to copy. Where Norah Jones had served coffeehouse introspection and Amy Winehouse brought back smoky defiance, Aly Berry seems the singer who could walk the middle ground between them, marrying intimacy and sheen in her own way. Where jazz is typically stuck in amber or subjected to fusion experimentation, Aly's is the refreshing common-sense approach. She is not trendy. Her voice takes on the heavy grain of an analog record in a dark room, but with a burst of lucidity that's unmistakably modern. Picture the mournful elegance of Chet Baker Sings remade in the soundtrack-sounding timbres of Vesper by Massive Attack, tempered but deeply affecting. </p>
