                <p><strong>STYLEX (UK): Turning Heat Into Beat</strong><br><br>There are songs that just make you move, and then there are songs that get the room to move. STYLEX's latest single Feel The Heat on Krafted Digital does just that. It's almost a pulse rather than a song,  a manufactured frenzy of the basslines, percussion, and nights-after nights' tension that is well-suited for the concrete dance floor and red lights. The UK producer has been honing his craft in the house and tech house audience with a groove-heavy, attitude-filled sound, but the thing that really distinguishes him is how he integrates those retro influences, Mark Knight's hard-as-nails drum programming, Martin Ikin's push into something living and current.<br><br>Prior to the studio, STYLEX discovered the true language of dance floors at Hakkasan, where he honed his timing as a resident DJ, knowing a crowd doesn't merely listen, they respond. His radio show, Tech House Unleashed on Data Transmission, is just as frenetic, a transmission of sweat and beat that never pauses to catch breath. Feel The Heat is followed by a Eastern Resident remix, turning the track into something trance-like and liquid, the post-dawn reflection of the main set tempest.<br><br>If you’ve been hooked on the industrial pulse of D. Ramirez or the late-night swagger of James Hurr, this release deserves a spot on your queue. It hits that sweet spot between club and consciousness, like the sound you’d catch between sets at Printworks or during the chase scene of a Nicholas Winding Refn film. In a scene obsessed with the next drop, STYLEX reminds us that rhythm is still the real story.<br><br><strong>The Shrubs: Surf, Static, and Second Winds</strong><br><br>The Shrubs are not shy about nostalgia — they're bringing it back with a nod. Fall Behind replaces their former slow-burning melancholy with a spoonful of surf rock that seems to have splashed straight from a VHS that has seen some sun. It's close, brightly hued, and low-key, with guitars that shine like sunlight off chrome and a rhythm section that rides the self-assured laconicism of a band that's found its groove. From their own studio, Flowers on the Wall, the song sounds as though it was made in their living room, all warmth and hiss, the kind of glitches that make old records sound genuine.<br><br>You can see The Ventures in their twang, perhaps a trace of The Bambi Molesters in the phrasing with reverb, but The Shrubs don't use the retro hand for novelty. They use it for feel. There's a feeling of camaraderie in their sound, the sibling rapport between Josh and Miguel, the comfortable groove that comes from playing with someone who gets your sentence done for you.<br><br>It’s hard not to think of Fall Behind in cinematic terms. Imagine a Sofia Coppola character taking a solo drive through small-town streets at sunset, or an early Tarantino montage where everything seems to hum with hidden energy. If you’ve had La Luz or Allah-Las on repeat, this one will slip right into your rotation. The Shrubs might call Houston home, but this record feels like the coast, endless, free, and full of echo.<br><br><strong>Stephanie Happening: Soundtracking the Self</strong><br><br>There is something enthralling about Stephanie Happening's Smash Hits. It hovers midway between confession and film anthem, throbbing to synths that glitter like city lights at 3 a.m. The Londoner has a talent for rendering weighty subjects, identity, trauma, survival, into songs that could soundtrack a whole film. It is music that wants to heal but will not shy away from the grime.<br><br>Stephanie's music is in the tradition of artists such as MUNA, Chvrches, and Christine and the Queens, smartly emotive, deeply personal, but built for the headliner. You can picture Smash Hits ending a teen coming-of-age film or foreshadowing a moment of quiet rebellion on Euphoria. There's revolution in every note, but release too, the kind that creeps up on you when you can finally lay down the veneer of all being okay.<br><br>Dissociative Identity Disorder chronicler that they are, Stephanie imposes fragmentation upon them. Their music is not chaos but control, a mosaic cut of existence. The production is vivid, but the voice slices through like truth in breaking silence. If ever you've ever needed music that's raw but cinematic, Smash Hits is that outsider type of song that doesn't capture the moment so much as lingers with you long after the lights remain on.</p>
<p><strong>wht.rbbt.obj: Noir Rock and the Final Station</strong><br><br>wht.rbbt.obj of Chicago are wrapping up their NATO Call Sign Trilogy with Oscar Bravo Juliett, and the third act of this cinematic movie sounds like it's been in the works in hideaway. Every song has the sound of being encoded, full of peril and desire, a mix of raw soul and rock grime native to smoky rooms and final cigarettes. Frank and River Rabbitte, a married couple, exchange tension and chemistry, their music caught between Amy Winehouse at her most provocative and The Black Keys at their grimiest.<br><br>The album closes out a stretch started by Whiskey Hotel Tango and Romeo Bravo Bravo Tango, and this third installment comes along like closing credits ,black, raucous, and lovely in its destruction. Oh, and Monsters of Nothing (The FURY Edition) is on the way, a collaboration with Chi-town's FURY that distills their noir to something more electric.<br><br>You might just picture Oscar Bravo Juliett cutting a neo-noir clip, envision Drive, Sin City, or a late-night Peaky Blinders offshoot. It's music with the rhythm of the city and the pain of the people still with it. If rock still has peril attached to it, wht.rbbt.obj show that it has not been domesticated.<br><br><strong>Rusty Reid: The Long Shadow of The Unreasonables</strong><br><br>Sometimes an album seems to have waited for the world to catch up with it. Rusty Reid's The Unreasonables was recorded years and years ago, sat in a dusty corner waiting to be released, a melodic rock time bomb that cuts just as cleanly through today's playlists. It's huge and stripped and feeling, like something that easily could have nestled on either side of Tom Petty or The Cars on a late-80s mix tape.<br><br>Rusty, operating out of the Pacific Northwest these days, abandons the political and philosophical bent of earlier work for something more stripped-down. The songs are ad-lib, lust, attitude, the strained nervous jump of a band that played because they wanted to. Attitude Change rocks like a saloon song, Piece of the Action hangs loose with Stones-like cool, and Shock Me bangs with a jukebox-and-late-night-play beat.<br><br>You can stack The Unreasonables back-to-back with Fleetwood Mac during the Rumours era or early Cheap Trick, rock filth sheathed in pop savvy. It's easy to imagine the album restored to life in some akin to Almost Famous or an updated Stranger Things set piece, distilling the mood of reckless abandon. For a forty-year-lost record, it sounds incredibly vital, a rediscovery that sounds like a reminder of the way things were back in the good old days of rock and roll before we all became too clever with it.</p>

<address class="align-center"><strong><a href="https://online.pubhtml5.com/jgwlo/bzyq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Magazine</a> | <a href="https://www.peecho.com/print/en/1983467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Print Magazine</a><br><br>For more details contact us at: <a href="mailto:volechomag@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volechomag@gmail.com</a></strong></address><hr style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><address class="align-center"> </address>
<p>Eleri Ward has already established herself as a one-woman Stephen Sondheim interpreter. Her acoustic folk albums A Perfect Little Death and Keep a Tender Distance reinterpreted the master's songs in horrorscopic personal language, catching The New York Times' and Forbes' attention and landing her on tour with Josh Groban. But on her first album of originals, Internal Rituals, released Sept. 26, Ward shines the light on herself. What comes across is an album that is grand and close, the voice of a showy voice re-writing its own script.</p>
<p class="align-center"><strong>Follow Our Playlist For More Music!</strong></p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><br>On 12 tracks, Ward bounds across the stripped-down folk that marked her Sondheim arrangements and into a more lush, more adventurous sound. Ethereal electronics swirl around intricately layered vocals, and glimpses of future-jazz, indie-pop, and heavenly ambience drift through the arrangements. At their center is her voice, a limber soprano that glides between registers, throbbing with feeling on a par with a string instrument. Though her covers albums demonstrated her facility as an interpreter, Internal Rituals reveals her to be a writer of vision and tough vulnerability.<br><br>The melodies themselves are drawn from the intensely personal, memories, astrological charts, emotional cycles, and they never sound narcissistic. Instead, they happen as intimate confidences, born of the shared heartbeat of love, fear, loss, and rebirth. There You Go implies karma is a blessing, with the hindsight recognition of gratitude. Float contains the nightmarish exhilaration of freedom. Venusian Light radiates self-love. Someone, Something New travels even further, mapping the complicated terrain of Ward's relationship with her biological father and the way trauma can repeat itself through generations.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2tDDozfRiM8hb85ptdVKUt?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p>Her own solo single, Run, is a turnaround. Propulsive synths and piano drive her delivery as she performs the thrum of throwing off outdated shackles. You know listening that Ward isn't so much announcing a new beginning so much as fashioning one. That feeling of momentum, of arrival, permeates the album as an entirety.<br><br>The title of the album, Internal Rituals, is fitting. The songs are reckonings and release rituals, almost personal healing rituals done on behalf of the listener. Ward has spoken about learning to make beats and produce D.I.Y. herself, taking control of her sound for the first time as a songwriter. You can hear the independence on the album. It isn't over-produced or aloof, it pulsates with the urgency of someone finding voice in the moment.<br><br>Ward's journey to this location has been steeped in performance for a long time. A five-year-old multi-instrumentalist, she went through the Chicago Academy for the Arts and Boston Conservatory before finding her career as an accomplished stage actor and recording artist. She played off-Broadway in Only Gold, acted in the American Repertory Theater's Gatsby, and most recently took center stage at the Miu Miu Tales &amp; Tellers fashion show. But Internal Rituals is not so much about displaying range as it is about taking up space. It is not the voice of an interpreter or a purveyor of other people's words—it is the voice of an artist finding herself in full.<br><br>There are times on the record that evoke the cinematic splendor of Björk or the unearthly fragility of Imogen Heap, but Ward is not imitating. She is building a sound world where dramatics and closeness exist together, where electronic beats can walk hand in hand with folk sympathies, and where the near becomes large enough to become communal.<br><br>Internal Rituals is not a debut album. It's an entry into adulthood. Through these songs, Ward moves beyond interpreter to designer of her own musical world, asserting that the desire which she had hitherto expressed through Sondheim was her own as well. And now, at last, she can express it in words.</p>

<p>Certain songs are torn from the moment, and others tug at the string of the past to show us how little things have actually changed. Sons of Racketeers' latest track "Beat The Press Gang" does both. Rooted in the violent past of press gangs at sea—whereby men were bullied or kidnapped into the service of English warships—the song also becomes a protest anthem in the present, one that hauntingly resonates with a world where children are still conscripted into wars they never chose.<br><br>To the ear, on initial listening, "Beat The Press Gang" is music to a folk story. The opening tangles into acoustic texture, a campfire storyteller drawing you in before the storm hits. And then the song breaks out into something more, bigger, and a whole lot more angry. Electric guitars slice in, drums push the rhythm ahead, and vocals soar into a virtuosic call to action. It's a change that reflects the tension of its subject—the subdued inception of a story that bursts forth into rebellion.<br><br>There is something epic in the building of this song. It's not much of a stretch to see it as the score to a historical epic like Master and Commander, but with an added injection of modern tension that would fit nicely into the hard-luck grind of Peaky Blinders. The folk roots keep it grounded in a tradition of tales of working lives, but the rock power charges it into the modern day, making the struggle concrete.<br><br>Lyrical-wise, Sons of Racketeers eschew sermonizing. They tap instead into the emotional content of the story. You feel the terror of men being turned out of their houses, the rage of losing power, and the fleeting burst of outrage in not taking it lying down. That's the human element that resonates with you. It's not sailors in the historical past—it's anybody today and now who are being drafted, displaced, or threatened with wars they never enlisted in.<br><br>The din reminds one of groups such as The Decemberists, who for a long time have blended folk heritage and rock narrative, but Sons of Racketeers venture further into electric fire. One hears a bit of The Pogues in the folk-punk edge of the song, and even Led Zeppelin when the band heads into its harder riffs. It's a hybrid that is raw-sounding and planned at the same time, as if the song was composed to be played live in a dense place where the audience can stomp and bellow along.<br><br>In a way, "Beat The Press Gang" is more than an album—it's a testament to what is possible in folk rock. It's protest music without slogans, history class without textbooks, and rock without the glaze. It doesn't try to be background music, but instead makes you feel the weight of its tale.<br><br>For those who adored the blaze of The National's "Bloodbuzz Ohio," the sweeping historical sagas of The Decemberists, or the tempestuous anger of Wolfmother, this song will be a refreshing addition to the playlist. And for those who have ever challenged authority, seethed at injustice, or simply craved a song that speaks to some primal urge, "Beat The Press Gang" comes with energy.<br><br>Sons of Racketeers have taken a black page from the past and made it a song that's as vibrant and contemporary as anything. It's a message that the past bites back, and that with just the right blend of folk and rock, it still does.</p>

<p>There are songs that are made for the dance floor, songs made for the trip home, and then those which leave you standing still where you are with the might of their honesty. Bran.AI's new song "Same Light" falls into the third category, a soulful ballad with that kind of timelessness you'd come to expect from an artist bold enough to bare their heart. It is one of perseverance built on and one of belief that there is always somebody out there in hard times who can catch and reflect your light back at you.<br><br>The power of "Same Light" is in its restraint. Bran.AI can croon along with untroubled clarity, with only a line committing itself that is both deeply personal and ubiquitously relatable. The arrangement is bare-bones enough to allow the vocal muscle to be the centre point but full enough to give the ballad some broad sonic scope. It's got the intimacy of a whispered secret but the grandeur of a film score, the sort of song that might soundtrack a climactic moment in a romance drama or one of those Netflix tearjerkers where the characters finally reveal what we, the audience, already knew anyway.<br><br>Essentially, "Same Light" is a love song, but not in the superficial manner of fleeting attraction. It is about what type of connection follows hurt, follows loss, follows disappointment. It is about understanding that someone else not just sees your scars but has some too, and somehow you both fit because of it, not despite it. That idea has the same emotional currency as timeless ballads such as Adele's "Someone Like You" or Lewis Capaldi's "Before You Go," where love and heartbreak blend into something greater than both.<br><br>Pop culture is full of stories that echo the spirit of “Same Light.” Think of Jesse and Céline in Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise, characters who seem destined to meet against all odds, or the way Greta Gerwig’s Little Women lingers on the quiet inevitability of soulmates finding each other through circumstance. Bran.AI’s ballad fits into that tradition, a reminder that even when the road feels unbearably long, something—or someone—waits at the end of it.<br><br>For fans of emotionally resonant songwriting, "Same Light" will find a home between more recent releases such as Gracie Abrams' The Secret of Us, or the raw emotional closeness of Noah Kahan's acoustic songs. And yet there is also a shimmering optimism that's nearer to Coldplay's stadium love anthems, those songs that make the stadiums nod along in harmony. Bran.AI manages to bridge those worlds somehow—hushed enough to sound confessional, but big enough to sound communal.<br><br>"Same Light" comes at a time when so much of the world seems to be in shambles, and perhaps that is why it is so powerful. Love songs are usually throwaways, but this is not. It sticks. It gives hope. It gives something to cling to, if only long enough for a few moments.<br><br>Bran.AI can call the song a message of hope, but it's every bit an entreaty—as in, have hope in connectivity, persevere through hardship, know that someone somewhere is making their way towards you under the same light.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a song appears that's larger than the amount of time it exists for. Reetoxa's latest release "Papa Loves Ladyboys" is just such a song—equal measure party anthem and social commentary. At its surface, it's a sparkling rock-pop track with a certain dancefloor magic. Beneath, it's an intensely personal tale of love, acceptance, and the bravery it takes to live openly, whatever your age.<br><br>The inspiration is as profound as suggested by the title. The song was born through a grown-up relative of the artist who, having lived in seclusion for years, revealed his true self to his family and accepted himself in the society of LGBTQ+. Instead of making the moment a ballad out of nostalgia, Reetoxa turns the tables and chooses to release joy, laughter, and liberation. The end result is a song that's both emotional and catch, making an act of confession one of freedom.<br><br>How "Papa Loves Ladyboys" works is that it's evenly split between sincerity and play. It's not burdened with sadness. Rather, it's on hue, rhythm, and playful tenderness, proving that even tales of adversity can be reworked as triumphs. It's as if the song runs in parallel with these anthems for joy and truth: Scissor Sisters' gay camp rebellion, Mika's campy but pinpointed storytelling. Camp, it's catchy, and evidence of music's long tradition of being one of the most effective ways of redefining how we speak about identity.<br><br>Sonically, the single is pretty far in the direction of dance-pop, with snarling synth lines, thudding percussion, and a beat that insists on movement. But it's not empty calories—the song is a sugar high with an anchor. The lyrics, sung winking and smiling, have the weight of acceptance, and the production keeps that weight from ever feeling heavy. It's the sort of tune you might find coming from a nightclub, a Pride parade, or even the midst of a family kitchen shindig, where its message of love and self-truth resonates equally.<br><br>Themed, the drop is in dialogue with pop culture's ever-perennially celebratory choruses of queer joy. Heartstopper and Pride are reminders that queer stories don't have to be tragedies—queer stories can instead be light, light and full of sound. Reetoxa's single is likewise invigorating: a nod that acceptance can be a dance chart-topper and not necessarily a dirge.<br><br>For those pop fans with something different in their bonnet, "Papa Loves Ladyboys" will sit nicely alongside the likes of Years &amp; Years, Troye Sivan, or even classic Kylie Minogue. It is silly, but it is not bubblegum. It is near, but it is not close in. It is the kind of single that you can't help but want to overanalyze while at the same time throwing your arms up in frustration.<br><br>Finally, "Papa Loves Ladyboys" is freedom disguised as a party, and it's why it's so powerful. Reetoxa has taken a private family tale and turned it into an anthem that overshoots—it's one that declares that regardless of who you are, it's never too late to discover the light, to laugh, and dance yourself into truth.</p>

<p>Portland upstart Micki XO turns fatigue into joy on new single "Power Outage," released today. A burst of electropop throb, bursts of fizzy noise, and a drop that hits like lightning, the song embodies the sensation of being running on fumes but somehow still having the getup to dance through.<br><br>At its core, "Power Outage" is a burnout song — the media overload, the never-ending cycle of politics, the grind of having two or three jobs. Micki is crooning about being tired and worn down, but the music springs to life, as if having the courage to declare that joy can still cut through the haze. The contrast is deliberate. "It's about offering an escape," says Micki. "Even for a few minutes, you get to forget the worry and refuel."<br><br>That epiphany was the result of a very literal power outage. Written from the midst of one of Portland's worst ice storms, when Micki had no electricity for almost two weeks, the solitary was based on the eerie tranquility of being disconnected. Without the ubiquitous illumination of screens, she knew sleep, silence, and focus. That paradox — that deprivation of power might, in fact, energize her — was the genesis of the song.<br><br>The track hums with nods to references so expansive as Lady Gaga, Rezz, and Dua Lipa. It becomes trance-like but motor, club-ready but intimate in a way that's safe for listening on headphones. Micki weaves hope into the rhythm, making "Power Outage" something of an anthem for anybody who feels pulled too thin but won't stay down.<br><br>Since starting her music career in pandemic year 2020, Micki XO has established herself on the Pacific Northwest circuit by playing at The Nines Hotel and Atlantis Lounge, releasing eight singles, and working with musicians around the globe. With several more releases in the works for 2025 and 2026, she is curating a catalog that blends sparkling pop with actual human heft.</p>

<p>The velvet rope and bottle service are a thing of the past. Solo artist Exzenya reinterprets the term in one way she can on her new song V.I.P.: Victim's Impact Panel. Rather than hard partying, the tune raises awareness about the voluntary program developed by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) that the offenders must visit after being charged with a DUI. It's a risky, forward-thinking move incorporating humor, candor, and bass-driven beats to talk about something everyone would rather avoid.<br><br>Right out of the starting gate, V.I.P. releases driving beats and unflinching bars, dragging the listener into a realm where satire and straight-up storytelling intersect. Court dates, cautionary stories, and dark humor-grudging responsibility all bubble up. The track doesn't idealize bad decisions, but it also doesn't sermonize. Rather, Exzenya knocks the other side into witty rhymes and hooks that have you nodding your head, chuckling, and pondering—and sometimes in the same sentence.<br><br>"These lyrics turn reality on its head," says Exzenya. "V.I.P. is about taking the worst, most cringe-worthy things in life and making them completely unforgettable. It's sick, it's sickening, and it's brutally honest."<br><br>The single comes first, as plain as can be, with a Clean Version and a Club Remix to come, sure to move the concept further yet through moods and listeners. As post-afterparty sequel to a courtroom tale told at an afterparty, every version reimagines the encounter without losing its bite.<br><br>For Exzenya, this release is right at home in a line-blurring discography. She's long made a living as a shrewd cultural observer, able to move seamlessly between intensely personal concept albums (Story of My Life) and, ironically, satirical analyses of nightlife and gossip-mongering (Bar Scenes, Rumors). Her background in communications and psychology manifests itself in every lyric, slicing through human psychology with humor and empathy.<br><br>Hip-hop has long thrived on flipping the script—think Kendrick Lamar’s “Swimming Pools” unraveling party culture, or The Last Poets bending street-level reality into performance poetry. V.I.P. joins that lineage, confronting consequence with swagger and satire. If court-mandated programs rarely leave an impression beyond tedium, Exzenya has turned one into a head-nodding cautionary tale you’ll actually want to revisit.<br><br>V.I.P. can be found anywhere today, making Exzenya a singer with the power to make the somber and the ridiculous unforgettable. It's not simply a hip-hop song. It's a cheeky reminder that even on our worst moments, there's a beat worth listening to—and maybe a lesson worth gleaned.</p>

<p>San Antonio native Jeremy Parsons has gained a following quite quietly, combining Americana, country, and dashes of electronica into a familiar, modern sound. Parsons started out in high school when the guitar became his tool for feeling and reflection. However, Parsons did have a talent for writing songs beyond melodies, condensing the harsh realities of life in Texas into a sense of honesty that would later become his hallmark. He has honed that craft since then, touring America and Europe, winning fans over with performances that are almost intimate in feel despite the numbers of people attending.<br><br>Having three full-length albums to his credit, Parsons has set an ongoing standard for sincerity and profundity. In 2023, he started to issue singles from his new EP, Life, with each offering showing the growth of an artist capable of maneuvering personal vulnerability and radio-friendly hook-crafting with equal finesse. His singles have consistently performed well, a few charting in the top regions of the UK iTunes charts and gathering more than 1.5 million streams on Spotify. Singles like Humanity and Life Worth Dyin' For have further cemented his sound on the radio, the latter charting as the number one National Radio Hits AC40 and Country airplay chart. Awards soon followed, with Parsons winning the 2024 New Music Award for Country Breakthrough Artist of the Year, and reaching the final of the 2024 New Folk Competition.<br><br>Parsons' new release, The Garden, shows him to be able to make remembrance and reflection into music that happens. Taken from his childhood and observations of mental illness, the song reached #45 on the Billboard Digital Songs Sales chart to affirm the success of his extremely personal music. Having that in mind, his latest release, Who Was I?, available September 5, offers an even more personal exploration of his growing-up. Born as a tongue-in-cheek reaction to a critic who had questioned the personal introspection of his 2021 album Things To Come, the song turned into an examination of youth, errors, and consciousness. Parsons looks back at life at age 25 with bald honesty that few songwriters have ever come close to, making confessional lines an universal reference point.<br><br>Couplets such as Sleeping through the days, living for the night / Yeah doing lots of things to see if I could die face up to the search and risk of youth, and his suave, leathery voice bring the tale into a real, human voice. Perhaps more than anything, Who Was I? equates Parsons' American roots with unflashy playing that supports but never overpowers, letting space for the tale to breathe. Jason Isbell, John Moreland, and Brandi Carlile fans will discover traces of the same unflinching honesty and emotional sincerity, and the fans of Boyhood and Lady Bird movies, which lay bare the complexity of coming-of-age and self-realization, will discover the cinematic sound in Parsons' songs.<br><br>The song, and earlier success, places Parsons as a voice reflective at a personal level but universal in appeal, one to be comforting for anyone passing through their own past. Parsons continuing to release songs from the Life EP establishes the precedent. Parsons is an artist who derives from experience lived, giving it back in music both personal and universal. With several new singles on the horizon, he is quietly gathering a body of work that will have him expand the parameters of Americana without ever losing sight of the type of storytelling that has made the genre so appealing for so long. Who Was I?<br><br>and the entire EP streams on MTS Records everywhere, inviting new listeners and longtime ones to come aboard Parsons as he looks back while looking ahead in an odd sense of direction and disconnection. For fans of contemplative country-inflected storytelling, this is music to spend time with. Pair a listening session with a late-night drive, a quiet coffee shop, or a walk through familiar streets, and you’ll understand why Jeremy Parsons is emerging as one of Americana’s most introspective and resonant voices.</p>

<p>Occasionally, an artist chooses to bring things back to basics. For Colourshop, London-bred, Barcelona-residing songwriter, his latest single Sailing Boat is that time. Out September 6, 2025, the single presents a bare-bones, acoustic sound that's at once intimate and gently insistent. Finally, after years of experimentation with changing sonic colors, Colourshop wagers everything on something less tense but by no means small-time. What ensues is a ballad that retains the bossa nova beat but also possesses a lyrical heaviness that lingers long after the song has finished its final fade.<br><br>Cut at RoomTo Studio in association with producers Oscar Bragado and Jason Boshoff, and featuring Bryan Curtis behind the drums, Sailing Boat glides with a nonchalance that appears to be planned. The sound never overwhelms the message, rather allowing the gentle guitar, loose percussion, and breezy rhythm to lead the listener. Its tone is that of Kings of Convenience's dainty clarity, Lianne La Havas's soulful nuance, and that stripped-back vulnerability that has characterized Damien Rice for so long. As with all those bands, Colourshop derives magic from restraint.<br><br>Essentially, Sailing Boat is more than a love ballad or introspective work of acoustic pop. It is a paean to mastery—or its failure. The maritime metaphor cuts deep, setting life as an endless dance with powers outside of our hands. The winds blow, the tides shift, and the best we can do is steer when we are able and let go when we cannot. In a universe that so celebrates control and certainty, Colourshop's message is one of the loveliness of release. Floating occasionally creates the most incredible views.<br><br>The message of this song is particularly pertinent in an era where doubt has become something of a ubiquitous shadow. It's an album that'll have listeners reminiscing about albums that conveyed the same emotions, whether it's Nick Drake's Pink Moon, Norah Jones's Come Away With Me, or even the movie-like calmness of João Gilberto's original bossa nova recordings. Like those, Sailing Boat won't be racing ahead. It encourages you to sit with it, to breathe a bit more slowly, and to notice that meaning does not always lie in where you arrive but in the way you arrive there.<br><br>Colourshop's relocation to Barcelona is on this as well. There's a sun-soaked tranquility to the song that is fitting for the Mediterranean terrain—something in which the sea itself is both source and metaphor. This relocation has the sense of less of an afterthought and more of a shift of direction, sending him toward something greater and more contemplative, as if the change of terrains served to shed fat to reveal something more intimate.<br><br>For aficionados of indie folk and acoustic soft-pop, Sailing Boat will be that late-night favorite—best consumed during a lonely walk home, or on Sunday afternoons when time slows down. It stands with the introverted closeness of Iron &amp; Wine's early era, the emotive dignity of Laura Marling, or the ambient coziness of José González. But even amongst that throng, the tone of Colourshop stands out, clean and sincere in intention.<br><br>This release might be viewed as turning inwards, but it is every bit an opening out—a widening of perspective that extends the invitation to the listener. Colourshop has written a track that acknowledges the turn of life, yet prefers to find comfort in its necessity. Sailing Boat is not a song about finding direction, it's one that finds that sometimes direction finds you.</p>

<p class="align-left">Melbourne experimental group Transgalactica is forcing us to rethink the nature of music and its role in daily life with their ephemeral release Marginal Music. For the most part, the release is all about the irony of contemporary culture consumption: where there were streaming sites, subscription platforms, and torrential masses of available digital music, now the marginal cost of listening to music has essentially hit zero. Transgalactica's music teases out what that looks like for both the listener and artist—while the masses are enjoying unprecedented freedom, talented artists must fend for themselves, relying on teaching, mixing, or wedding gigs rather than solely their art.<br><br>The group's newest release, Discounted Blessings, thematizes this tension in a fearlessly conceptual manner. The song is argumentative and contemplative in the introduction and verses, then descending into a catastrophic progressive metal bridge that addresses how much is on the line when the quality of music is neglected. It's thematically disapproving of corporate control of the industry, citing monopoly gaming of live performances by corporations such as Live Nation, and lightheartedly invites one to ponder the long-term ramifications of indulging in low-effort, commercially oriented music. Transgalactica even takes the step of suggesting a pseudo-scientific hypothesis: listening to "trashy" music during your lifetime dooms you to an eternity of hearing it, a tart comment on cultural value and aesthetics.<br><br>Texture and sound-wise, the work is a dense blend. The group takes material from Bizet's opera Carmen, overlaying classical with new electronica and metal material to create tension between old and new consumption. The sound that follows is cerebral and visceral, requiring attention space with room for thought. It's a testament to the means by which music may be at once personal, social, and abstract, calling to the fans of artists like Matmos, The Books, or early Bjork, where odd shapes and meta-reflection on culture are paired.<br><br>Transgalactica's interviews are as irreverent, humorous, and unapologetic as their sound. They talk of hypocrisy in enjoying free content but giving tips on how to sustain support via streaming instead of paying directly. They marvel at the limitations of choice under contemporary music, citing how corporate interests primarily determine who is seen and how the fans consume, echoing complaints under discussion of cultural gatekeeping such as 24 Hour Party People or films like Artifact.<br><br>Early responses boast both intellectual sophistication and playfully irreverent humor of Transgalactica. Both critics and admirers applaud the endeavor for straddling the thin line between criticism and amusement, maintaining a urbane equipoise that is neither alienating nor impenetrable. Marginal Music invites listeners to consider their own position in the world of culture as well as offering up an ample, genre-defying audio experience.<br><br>For listeners who'd love to hear more of these concepts explored, the song nestles into comfortable territory with experimental and socially conscious music projects. Imagine Jon Hopkins' complex textures, Laurie Anderson's narrative, or even The Flaming Lips' more abstract conceptual endeavors. On video, the systems' breakdown and culture that we witness in Her or Sorry to Bother You is matched by the same questions Transgalactica raises of music, value, and control. Marginal Music is a challenging work which repays close listening and attention with humor, wit, and solid musicianship articulated as an organic whole.</p>
