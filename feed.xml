                <p><br>Melbourne's Ratfink! are back with a snappy message. New single Plastic Bits, the third release from the forthcoming album When U Were Mine, sees the band's unique blend of three-chord rock energy and surf pop gloss. There's a hooky catchiness to the song which reminds one of the way early garage rock could be both urgent and fun, the kind of song that catches your head on first play.<br><br>The stimulus is close to hand: the city's waterways. Afternoon spent on the Merri River's muddy banks was followed by the band considering the plastic that blanketed the landscape. That consciousness leaks into the song in little details, from the slightly out-of-tune guitar lines that mimic the disorientation of rubbish to the beat that skips like water over rocks. The album blends social observation with playfulness, proving that Ratfink! is able to speak about real-world concerns without sacrificing the energy of rock n roll.<br><br>Current fans will see the familiar hooks and brute power that have characterized their output, but new listeners might find an identical draw in how groups like The Strokes or Thee Oh Sees combine immediacy with melody. Plastic Bits is economical but powerful, a sleek primer to the more expansive soundscapes and narrative the band are venturing into with When U Were Mine. It's a reminder that rock music can still be new, paying attention, and starkly alive, even constructed out of three basic chords.<br><br>For those who dig music that blends grit and intelligent thinking, Plastic Bits is a bull's-eye. It's a song to crank up loud, to hear the city in a new way, and to get stoked on what Ratfink! has next.</p>

                <p class="align-left">There is something delicious about a song that laughs in the face of its subject, and Kaiyah Mercedes knows exactly how to pull it off. With I’m Gonna Be Famous, the Melbourne-based queer pop-rock artist flips the script on the exes, friends, and hangers-on who once tried to shrink her voice or claim credit for her rise. It's cheeky, snappy, and brimming with the sort of sassy attitude that's present in Lily Allen, Olivia Rodrigo, and pre-peaking Charli XCX's line — acts who understand how to attach flames to truth. <br><br>The song explodes with jangly guitars, hooky hooks, and just the appropriate amount of grit. Kaiyah is both stubborn and playful sounding, spitting her back on past and stepping into own spotlight. At 19, she already has a woman's confidence in that she has rammed against the walls and not shrunk, instead taking up even more space. It is a song for anyone ever instructed to be quiet, smaller, less of themselves — and it throbs like a theme song, sneering and smirking in equal proportion.<br><br>Her ascent has been gradual but impressive. Two albums in with more than 1.2 million combined streams, Indie Arrivals, The Pop List, and Pop Sauce placements on Spotify, Kaiyah's established she ain't afraid of pushing genre. Indie pop is at its core, though folk and rock textures are woven throughout her songs, making her sound more like Phoebe Bridgers, Soccer Mommy, and beabadoobee. I’m Gonna Be Famous sharpens her sound even further, leaning into a rawer, rockier palette that suggests she is ready to throw punches instead of simply baring scars.<br><br>What makes Kaiyah stand out goes beyond the music. Diagnosed with autism and ADHD at 15, followed by a series of chronic illnesses, she has turned her body and brain into sources of resilience rather than restriction. Her music is not just catharsis, but maps of self-discovery, doorways to being young, queer, and unapologetically different. And that same honesty overflows into her live performances, which function more as point gatherers for community than as typical gigs. Fans are invited into a safe, charged environment that clinically reveres queer, disabled, and neurodivergent life — testimony that music can be art and sanctuary.<br><br>You can hear the echoes of pop culture's best comebacks against contempt and skepticism in I'm Gonna Be Famous. It takes the nod of Alanis Morissette's You Oughta Know, the teen zing of Mean Girls' revenge paybacks, and even the glee sting of Taylor Swift's We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. But Kaiyah never takes on the tropes. Instead, she weaves her own take into a funny and needed song. It's easy to picture this playing in bedrooms, car rides, or at the end of the night when you're messing around with friends about the people who didn't think you were good enough.<br><br>The song is also, however, a commentary on fame itself — who gets to own it, who gets left out of the narrative, and how frequently women and queer artists are informed their success isn't theirs. By satirizing those claims in so many words, Kaiyah owns her narrative and won't give the praise away to anyone who sought to put her fire out.<br><br>Admirers of the same level of energy will be able to find it in Wet Leg's debut snappy sarcasm, MARINA's Electra Heart campy venom, or even Fleabag's camp confidence. They all tread what it takes to mock rejection's pain and make strength out of hurt. Kaiyah is definitely a member of that legacy, laying down her own voice among the emerging ranks of emerging creatives who refuse to be silenced.<br><br>At just 19, Kaiyah Mercedes has already carved out a reputation as one of Melbourne’s most compelling voices. With I’m Gonna Be Famous, she is not asking for recognition — she is declaring it. And the fun of it all is that she is in on the joke, tossing her past detractors a grin as she keeps moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>How did it feel to reunite musically after 20 years since Ambiossis?</strong><br><br>Clint: It actually was interesting. We didn't really hang out anymore for such a long time and I myself hadn't done anything with music for about 8 years.<br><br>One day I was jogging and listening to tunes when all of a sudden our old band Ambiossis popped up, whilest we did not upload the music on Spotify and I did not select it. So while I was running and one of the tracks kicked in, I was thinking, 'I wonder how Remy is doing?'. So I send him a message and we met up and basically expressed wanting to make some tunes in general.<br><br>The whole process went weirdly natural and was so smooth, the first track was lyrically and vocally written and recorded before the end of the next week, so we basically had our base down in no time.</p>

<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><br><strong>What was the spark that led to creating "Snatched"?</strong><br><br>Remy: We were sitting around while I jammed some grooves on my guitar. It reminded us of the old-school nu-metal we grew up with a groove that makes your head bop and gives you the urge to run through the streets for no reason at all. The verses and choruses came naturally, because back when we had a band together from 2003 to 2006 (Ambiossis), we already blended groove, rap verses, and big ballad-like choruses. It felt like we simply picked up where we left off in 2006.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5HMwEqcFmgJ9BOyudzx6jr?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>What emotions do you hope listeners take from "Snatched"?</strong><br><br>Clint: I of course, hope it gives people a positive or helpful feeling or emotion, but honestly, any emotion will do. As long as people feel a certain way about what we made. Feel free to love the track, we hope you do, but also feel free to hate it or dislike it. Music is universal and the beauty of it, is that it connects with some and doesn't with others. There is enough to go around :) But of course, we make music and share it for people to hopefully connect to it and love it.<br><br><strong>Why did you choose to record in home studios instead of a traditional setup?</strong><br><br>Remy: With so many instruments being multi-sampled in the best studios, and plugins -especially guitar amps- sounding better than ever, particularly in the last five years, I personally don’t feel the need to record in a traditional studio. I have great memories of working in them, but it’s just not convenient for me. Recording at home saves money and removes time pressure. I've been recording demos at home since around 2000, and by 2003 I was already using a guitar amp sim floorboard for both live gigs and home sessions.</p>
<p><strong>How has your creative process evolved since your early band days?</strong><br><br>Remy: It’s quite similar, but with all great sounding plugins and libraries these days I just start out with synths / weird sounds / drums before I even do guitars, because it sparks guitar riff idea's. Back then, we just had some rough guitar parts and vocal sketches as demos, often guessing what the final product would sound like. Now, while recording it almost sounds like the end product, which sparks more idea's. But we still sit around working out the guitar parts like the early days and Clint have his lyrics done in a couple of hours and he sends his vocal-demo the next day, so that stayed the same.<br><br><strong>What’s next for Neverskin after this debut single?</strong><br><br>Clint: Well, lets say we hope to reach as many people as we can with our debut single 'Snatched' first off.<br><br>Next step will be the release of our second single. I won't spoil to much about that one yet. Long term, we're more or less winging it and basing it on how people receive it. So although there are no plans yet, we could end up going live, recording an EP or album, or perhaps keeping it on the low. Let's see...</p>
<p><strong>If you could describe your music in three words, what would they be?</strong><br><br>Clint: Oh that is a though one. I guess, 'Emotional' (full of all types of emotion), 'Free' (not limited by boundaries, we make what we feel, could be this now and something completely different later), 'Expressive' (lyrics are metaphorical, the music is whatever we feel like we want it to be)</p>

<p>When Serbian singer and performer JA Lena proclaims Ana Elli Hena—"I Am the One Here", she is not doing so for fun. It is a confident act of artistic assertion. This is a Serbian artist singing Egyptian Arabic, drawing on Balkan dynamism and oriental beats into a sound as obstreperous as it is spellbinding. It's the newest entry in her increasing body of work, and one that may be her most brazen so far.</p>

<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p>JA Lena has been gathering steam for the last several years with songs such as Katila and Gamila, both of which gave listeners a sense of her unique approach to blending traditions. Those songs promised much, but Ana Elli Hena leaves no doubt. The production is crisp, layered with throbbing percussion and melodies that sound ancient yet new, while her vocal performance cuts through the mix with conviction. It is more than a statement about sound, though. It is a statement about presence.<br><br>There is something compelling in how Lena moves between worlds. Having grown up in Serbia, she was immersed in the raw passion of Balkan music, a tradition founded on intricate rhythms and emotional directness. In Ana Elli Hena, she brings that heat to Arabic performance, where the modal scales and cyclical rhythms of Egyptian music provide her with something new to challenge. Rather than reducing those styles to something bland, she keeps tension between them alive. The song flourishes there.<br><br>This cross-cultural bridging is not just about musical structure, but also about point of view. In deciding to sing in Egyptian Arabic alone, Lena positions herself to be challenged and celebrated. For the Arab community, there is intrigue in listening to a foreign artist adopt the language and perform it with such passion. For audiences in the Balkans, there is excitement in witnessing one of their own venture so much farther than anticipated. In both instances, the end result is connection. She will not remain in one lane, and it is that refusal that is essentially what provides her voice power.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1QaIGEG2l2mZE5WwXPLADq?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br>Themed, Ana Elli Hena is about taking up space in a world which continually attempts to define and confine women's being. The name alone is a statement: "I am the one here." The refrain throughout the song holds almost incantatory authority, as if addressed to an audience, an enemy, and a self simultaneously. A song of strength, it is indeed, but one of survival also. It resists erasure by being impossible to overlook.<br><br>The song also has a cinematic feel. One can picture it scoring a climactic scene in a movie, a confrontation, say, or a moment when the hero finally takes hold of their authority. So it is that Lena's work draws to mind such artists as Sevdaliza, whose Persian-Dutch heritage drives similarly boundary-pushing experimentation, or even M.I.A., who blended Tamil origins with London's underground culture. As they do, Lena employs pop formats and club-friendly beats as a medium for something more profound, something pegged to history, language, and identity politics.<br><br>Ana Elli Hena finds herself in a moment in culture where global pop has become more permeable. Think about how Rosalía constructed El Mal Querer from flamenco heritage into a global pop album, or the way Stromae transformed Belgian chanson into electronic anthems. JA Lena is not part of a trend, but she is part of this movement of artists not willing to let geography confine them. Serbian and Arabic traditions are not different boxes to her, but sparks waiting to ignite one another.<br><br></p>

<p>In the hauntingly silent darkness of their July drop Winter on the Vine, Danish dark-pop group TRALALAS come back with Burns, a song that is its own subdued inflammatory. While the initial single mapped the cycles of transformation and clenched quiet of complicity, Burns turns in. At three and thirty seconds, it's close but sweeping, an exploration of the capriciousness of human relationship and the manner in which feelings ricochet back and forth between gain and loss, proximity and distance.</p>

<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><br>With songwriting and frontman Morten Alsinger as its core, TRALALAS construct their sound more as a group constructing atmosphere. You can feel it in the textures—warm analog production, Heidi Lindahl's ghostly harmonies twisting around Alsinger's voice, Christina Schmidt Damm's calm keys, Thomas Golzen's bass and guitar lines twining around the beat, and Francis Nørgaard Jensen's restrained percussion. Featuring Thomas Li on co-production, the track inhales with accuracy, every moment suspended between light and shadow.<br><br>Alsinger describes his writing as essayistic, and so it is. These are not free-floating lyrics. They are statements of mind abbreviated in action, inner voice expelled. His invocation of Montaigne—"I write from the dark against the light"—does as much to record not just the ethos of Burns but the larger enterprise being constructed on in TRALALAS' self-titled debut album out in October. The group don't require simplistic answers or moralities. They require perspective, the place where you end up when you stay with brokenness long enough for its rough edges to get in your face.<br><br>In that way, Burns is a companion piece to Winter on the Vine. Together, the two singles map out the territory for an album that will be an inner examination of vulnerability and intensity, composed not in slogans but in slow-burning patience. If Winter on the Vine was a lesson in circles, then Burns is about embers left over, the way love, friendship, and loss slice us open and leave us walking around the ashes searching for shape.<br><br>The music is in the dark-pop style of someone like Zola Jesus, Agnes Obel, or the more subdued edges of Depeche Mode, but TRALALAS form their own sound. The music is electric and muted, cinematic but not overwrought. It's the kind of song that doesn't sweep you in with bombast but sweeps you in with sound, until you find yourself leaning forward just to hear the next turn.<br><br>And at the end of Burns, there is left not just the lyric or the hook but the space between them. It is a record that requires repeat listens not because it is catchy in the traditional way, but because it leaves an emotional residue. And in that which remains, half shadow, half flame, you begin to see what TRALALAS are constructing towards: an album which harnesses the vulnerability as fuel rather than extinguishes it.</p>

<p>Marianne Nowottny has been a chameleon of a sort for all her working life. A composer, she has spent decades bending her voice to unearthly colors, stretching the limits of phrasing and atmosphere. Now, playing in her longtime alter ego Marzanna, she's pushed the cover album format in an album that is both predestined and unexpected. Plainly named Marzanna, the album combines covers of Kate Bush, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and others' songs, songs that have intrinsic strong signatures, but here drawn into darker, dreamier landscapes.</p>

<p><br>Covers aren't unfamiliar ground for Nowottny. She has dropped them around in her catalogue in records and live shows, Yazoo, Anne Murray, the Beatles, Nico, the Platters, Johnny Cash, Astrud Gilberto. But never has she given herself over entirely to the form. That's a central decision. It's not going back from writing to record an entire album of other people's work, but to claim a different type of writing: one that's informed by attentive listening, on shaping familiar melodies into new space until they're sounds like ghosts talking in new tongues.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4fdAOtFptYOG82sR6iIaOd?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br>She prolongs syllables so they hang, and shortens others with snapping sparks. That alone will set a mood, a mood where even the most familiar songs feel haunted, reborn. Hearing Marzanna sing Bowie or Joni Mitchell is to hear like the song is recalling itself in a dream, rewriting the edges of memory.<br><br>The making of the record wasn't easy. By the artist's own account, it nearly didn't happen at all. The five-year cycle of stoppages, respins, and technological catastrophes, crashed hard drives, misplaced songs, the plodding grind of start-over, should have killed the project a hundred times over. Instead, they imparted a sort of ruggedness. What ultimately came in sounds worn down by effort but unexpectedly calm, as if the perseverance it took to complete it infused the recordings themselves.<br><br>Marzanna did not embark on this trip alone. She extended a hand, calling in musicians and friends of all corners of the globe to carry their voices, their instruments, and themselves. That sense of camaraderie pervades the album, though mood continues ever her own. These are songs, also, with their revered beginnings concealed behind the illusion that they're being shared in hushed tones from room to room.<br><br>What is interesting about Marzanna is not that it reimagines the cover album, but that it tackles the concept uncharacteristically seriously. Rather than attempting to out-play the originals or play them ironically, Nowottny utilizes them as portals, familiar gateways that open up into foreign, fog-filled rooms. And in doing so, she demonstrates something about covers that is commonly lost: that they are not imitation or retro, but conversation. About how one hears a song differently from another's past, their phrasing, their suffering, their joy.<br><br>Through this album, Marzanna flips inside out the songs we thought we knew by heart, so we may hear them, as if for the very first time. It's not copy. It's revivification. And it echoes on long after the final note disappears.</p>

<p>From the Cambrian moors to Bristol's streets of strife, Moletrap are sounding as tough and vital as the terrain that brought them up. The band release Mid Welsh, Pt 1, a five-track EP which manages to both use the crash of guitars and the gentle determination of Mid Wales itself. It is a record, not an album. It is a reckoning with identity, with language, and with what it's like to be from somewhere history books and pop culture have forgotten.</p>

<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7nCQfSSikvEPorn78ARusH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p>The EP is the product of being in good form. Early singles such as Rhagofn and Middle of the Land were widely hailed for their blend of melodic pop sensibilities and bone-crunching heaviness. BBC Introducing described the music as "un-ignorably great" and vowed "a thousand mosh pits await." Which isn't hype. There is a sense of urgency to these songs that evokes the sense of getting on with it of early Manic Street Preachers, combined with the restless energy of current alt-rock bands like Idles.<br><br>What gives Mid Welsh, Pt 1 its bite is not so much the dynamics of the guitars or the authority of the vocals as the earthiness of experience. The members of the band met initially in Welsh-language school, where they once attempted to escape. When they left, all they could do was escape from what they had called "the least settled part of Wales and England." Years later, however, music beckoned them back to their roots. They've discovered their own history, traced the unmarked routes of the Cambrians, and challenged how colonisation and erasure have left their mark on the Welsh language.<br><br>All that tension is crammed into every one of those songs. Nation of Sanctuary hails Wales' openness to the world, while Rhagofn cautions against smugness in respect of work remaining to be undertaken. Taffy and What a Beautiful Place gaze inward on issues of heritage and belonging, while the title track is more like a reclaimed anthem. Every cut is full of both urgency and sensitivity, as though the band are grasping something delicate even as they crank the volume to eleven.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4dBkAxAKrRa1w7DZNCuSvf?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br>Moletrap's sound is full of contradiction in the finest sense. They are bilingual but international, refined but abrasive, politicized but intensely personal. Their riffs crash and churn like the mountains to which they continually refer, but the melody soars with hooks that stick long after the distortion wears off. That dichotomy is what makes Mid Welsh, Pt 1 not only a potent debut album but an important cultural statement.<br><br>The band openly talk about the chaos of their musical creation, of jam sessions turned into something far larger. They credit BBC Horizons and all the DJs, writers, and communities that raised them up. That humility only makes the music more powerful. Moletrap are not faking to be saviors of Welsh heritage, but as three friends with guitars, drums, and resolve getting back to where they belong.<br><br>Listening to Mid Welsh, Pt 1, you can hear a band still working out their mythology but sounding as though already they have something profound in their hands. Their music is heavy enough to rattle halls but intelligent enough to contain a lesson in history in its chords. Ultimately, Moletrap do just what they aim to do. They sound like the Cambrian Mountains rolling downhill, unstoppable, unquietable.</p>
