<p class="align-center"><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Issue #10</strong></p>
<address class="align-center"><address class="align-center"><strong><a href="https://pubhtml5.com/jgwlo/ixrz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Magazine</a> | <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/oddstone-printed-media-group/volecho-issue-10/paperback/product-dy8gm46.html?page=1&amp;pageSize=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Print Magazine</a></strong></address></address>
<p data-start="72" data-end="486">There is a particular kind of honesty that only shows up when an artist stops trying to impress and starts trying to tell the truth. Barry Allen’s album Perhaps lives in that space. Released in the spring of 2021, it is a record shaped by reflection, patience, and a willingness to sit with difficult feelings rather than dress them up. It does not announce itself loudly. It earns your attention by being sincere.</p>
<p data-start="488" data-end="1030">Barry Allen is a singer songwriter and guitarist from London, based in Streatham Hill, whose work leans toward folk but never feels boxed in by it. Perhaps came together during a charged and reflective period in his life, and you can hear that context in every track. These songs feel written at close range, as if the listener has been invited into the room rather than placed at a safe distance. The emotional tone is personal, but never closed off. It reaches outward, trusting that others will recognize themselves somewhere in the lines.</p>
<p data-start="1032" data-end="1449">The influence of writers like Joni Mitchell is easy to hear, not in imitation but in approach. Barry shares her interest in emotional clarity and melodic honesty. There is also a trace of Roy Orbison’s sense of vulnerability, that willingness to let feeling lead without irony or defense. These are songs that accept tenderness as strength. They do not hide behind metaphor when plain language will do the job better.</p>
<p data-start="1451" data-end="1958">Perhaps was recorded at the home studio of pianist Mike Cliffe in Chessington. The two met at the YMCA, a detail that feels fitting given the album’s grounded, human scale. Mike’s classical background adds depth to the arrangements without pulling them away from their folk core. Piano lines drift in gently, offering support rather than spotlight. The production keeps things close and natural. You can hear fingers on strings, breath between phrases, the quiet moments that often get edited out elsewhere.</p>
<p data-start="1451" data-end="1958"> </p>
<div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 450px; position: relative;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2172556&amp;show_artwork=true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div></div>
<p data-start="1960" data-end="2350">Tracks like Stay and In The Darkness carry much of the album’s emotional center. Stay feels like a conversation that has been rehearsed too many times in one’s head before finally being spoken aloud. In The Darkness leans into solitude without glamorizing it, allowing the song to move slowly and honestly. These are not dramatic performances. They are calm admissions, delivered with care.</p>
<p data-start="2352" data-end="2688">What makes Perhaps stand out in Barry Allen’s catalog is its consistency of mood and purpose. Each song feels connected, part of the same emotional landscape. There is no rush to vary tone for the sake of variety. Instead, the album trusts its own voice. It understands that intimacy can be compelling when it is handled with restraint.</p>
<p data-start="2690" data-end="3177">In a broader sense, the record fits alongside albums that value songwriting as craft rather than spectacle. Fans of quieter folk records from artists like Nick Drake, early Leonard Cohen, or more recent releases from Laura Marling will find familiar ground here. There is also a cinematic quality to the pacing, the way songs unfold without hurry, recalling films that focus on interior lives rather than plot twists. These are songs for late evenings, for listening without distraction.</p>
<p data-start="3179" data-end="3478">Barry Allen does not present himself as a performer chasing attention. He comes across as someone committed to making sense of experience through music, and inviting others to do the same. Perhaps feels like a snapshot of a moment when writing songs was less about ambition and more about necessity.</p>
<p data-start="3480" data-end="3727" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For listeners who value emotional openness, careful melodies, and records that reward time spent with them, Perhaps is worth returning to. It does not ask for much. It simply asks you to listen closely, and to be honest with yourself while you do.</p>

<p>Few musicians combine the level of experience and the curiosity, authenticity, and ingenuity that Gregg McKella brings to the table. With a songwriting history dating back to the early 1980s, McKella has honed a unique voice that lends itself well to small venues and immersive shows. A multi-talented musician, vocalist, and songwriter, he weaves together the clarinet, guitar, glissando guitar, synths, and space FX to deliver shows that fluidly shift from folk, psychedelic blues, alternative indie rock, and the eclectic genre he’s dubbed "space-folk" for years.<br><br>McKella, born in Aylesbury, originally came to prominence with The Presence, touring with the likes of Marillion and Ozric Tentacles. A move to London in 1987 saw him form Image Wot Image with Jeanette Murphy, resulting in extensive touring throughout London, the South East, and festival dates. In 1997, McKella founded Paradise 9 in Brighton, a psychedelia/proto-punk/space rock outfit, becoming a cult staple within the UK underground music scene. Albums such as "Showtime" (1999), "Take Me to the Future" (2013), with Nik Turner and Judge Trev Thoms, and "Science Fiction Reality" (2020), released through Flicknife Records, demonstrate McKella’s talent for incorporating psychedelia with a punk attitude, always with an emphasis on the unexpected.</p>

<p><br><br>Gregg's solo work is infused with a deeply personal sound, born out of years of musical exploration. His first solo album release in December 2025, Songs From the Underground, is a reflection of his time as a street busker in the 1990s and his passion for storytelling. This solo work is the result of production by Martin (Litmus) and is characterized by song-oriented folk music with elements of psychedelia and alternative music, supplemented by the addition of Nick Pynn, Jeanette Murphy, Tyrone Thomas, and Mr Eugene. The addition of violin sections, background vocals, and guitar parts adds depth to the music without muddying the lead vocals by McKella.<br><br>In addition to his own projects, his collaborations are a who’s who of the underground and progressive music scenes, from Nik Turner’s Inner City Unit to Mick Farren &amp; The Portobello Allstars, and from Spirits Burning &amp; Michael Moorcock to his associations with Pink Floyd, Gong, Hawkwind, and Blue Öyster Cult. He is, of course, a core player of the Daevid Allen Glissando Guitar Orchestra, where he employs the legendary seven drone method, a reflection of his skill and his willingness to push the boundaries of sonic exploration.<br><br>Regardless of whether McKella is performing alone or as a collaboration, his shows are marked by warmth and creativity. McKella’s music is best suited for an intimate setting or alternative festivals and arts spaces. Every note and every lyric is infused with a lifetime of underground music. This is an extraordinary offering for listeners, as it brings them history as well as an immediate connection.<br><br>Gregg McKella is more than a performer; he is a subculture original whose work demands listening. For those looking for something different, his performances offer the possibility of engagement, thought, and the excitement of music that is at once timeless and unique. Book Gregg McKella today and give your audience the benefit of his decades of underground knowledge and experimental ideas combined with the warmth of storytelling.</p>

<p class="align-center">At 23, Perth's Kristin Grayden is making a name for herself in the realm of pop-rock that's not only relatable but infectious. In her latest single, “Caffeine,” which was released on December 31, 2025, she turns the focus inward, addressing the toll of tedium, mental fatigue, and the little things that keep us going in life. This song gives a glimpse into what it's like to go through an 8-to-4 job, with a daily McDonald's breakfast being a substitute for comfort in the midst of a stressful working life.<br><br>The interesting thing about “Caffeine” is the way Grayden is able to walk the line between the very personal and the very universal. The track conveys the feeling of ennui that comes with everyday life, all while keeping a strong upbeat pulse. The listener senses the authenticity of her lyrics, but the production, which is all Grayden, is able to keep the track feeling uplifting.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/7Kq0wL79FjmHrl36D8Ik6f?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p class="align-center"><br>Grayden wrote, edited, and produced the song herself, which is quite unusual for such a young artist. Every detail, from the structure to the delivery, is infused with her perspective and skill. There’s an acknowledgment of the influence that artists such as P!nk have had on the pop-rock sound, but Caffeine does not sound like it borrows from anyone. Rather, it is a product that stems from a place of honesty and has been crafted with care.<br><br>The story told through Caffeine is also leading up to Grayden's next album release in May 2026. As a teaser leading up to this release, the song touches on ideas such as resilience, self-reflection, and the ability to find humor in stressful situations—all ideas which seem particularly relevant to listeners as they work through their own schedules and struggles with mental wellness. Even as the lyrics speak to specific ideas such as fast food and office time, the feelings remain very general: exhaustion, longing, and the little victories found in everyday life. "Caffeine" is an important entry in the emerging discography of Kristin Grayden, and it represents the artist’s strengths as a songwriter as much as it represents the artist’s capacity to take experiences and make them into compelling songs. For fans of artists who like to incorporate personal storytelling into their energetic pop rock, Grayden is an important voice to hear because she is honest, witty, and unique.</p>

<p class="align-center">Brandon Castillo, or Cas the Don as he is better known, has been steadily cultivating a varied musical identity that encompasses smooth R&amp;B, intellectually stimulating hip hop, and even neo-soul-infused narratives. His latest track release, What’re We to Do, which came out at the end of 2025, encapsulates this diversity as it seamlessly weaves together social commentary and self-reflection. This is part of a series of releases in promotion of his forthcoming album, titled Faceted.<br><br>The song begins with a staccato, even jarring, metaphor that sets the tone for the rest of the song: “Going through life while someone poking us with a stick / put their tongue on our ice cream ‘fore we got a lick.” Castillo establishes in the first line that life is a world that is working to subvert and oppress its citizens. “Jobs not over til we’re truly free” and “Is it selfish to ask for more, or is it what I was born to be?” suggest a complex interplay of ambition, morality, and strength in a world that is not always supportive. The chorus, “Too much shit to lose, ain’t no time to snooze,” is a call to action that goes far beyond the song itself.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1JNjn97PrqeLES2F563KvE?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>"What're We to Do" sets itself apart not only in its lyrics but in its visual storytelling as well. The album cover is presented as a retro-style front page of a newspaper called "The Freedom Chronicle," and it drops the listener into a world of growing international conflicts and humanitarian crises. The Statue of Liberty looming in the background among ruins suggests the vulnerability of freedom itself, and the chorus "All this on the news? Why we gotta choose?" encapsulates how macro-level events filter down into an individual level of reflection. The song very clearly places itself within the current moment of U.S. airstrikes in Yemen and uprisings around Africa and the Middle East but is also very intimate in its questioning of how one perseveres in moral and emotional ways within an unmoored world.<br><br>Musically, Cas the Don draws from Lauryn Hill, incorporating neo-soul elements, harmonies, and delivery that ranges from conversational to poetic. The production allows for each word to fully resonate, finding balance between the flow and the meaning. Even in more aggressive moments, like in the final word of the final line, “Why bite when I can smell the fear in you?” Castillo exercises self-control and composes herself.<br><br>The career of Cas the Don has been consistently on the rise. Since his debut SoundCloud uploads in 2020, with debut singles such as “I Know” and “Be Calm,” and more recent tracks such as “Nobody Listening” and “Heritage,” he has cultivated a loyal fan base. “Keep It Goin,” his bittersweet single, appeared in Honk Magazine, and “Inner Machinations of My Mind,” his EP, addressed political, social, and personal struggles with a level of sophistication that is not often present in debut releases by an artist so young. More recent releases, such as “Partier” and “Insurance,” demonstrate Castillo's awareness of mainstream appeal and lyrical sophistication.<br><br>"What’re We to Do" is more than a song, more than a critique and more than an anthem—it’s all these things and more. In a world where inflation, real estate, climate change, and politics have become a way of life, Castillo urges listeners to think not just about resilience and justice, but also about what happens on a daily basis, and what kind of choices one makes as an individual, as a human being, and as a member of society.

<p class="align-center">Antonio David, a French singer-songwriter, comes back with a very intimate track, “Entre tes mains,” released on January 5th, 2026. Born in Angers, David has produced a track that exudes a great deal of soul and introspection, as well as a desire to push the boundaries offered by modern production techniques.<br><br>Completely recorded in his hometown using only his phone, “Entre tes mains” is a lesson in subtlety and restraint. Underlying it all, of course, is a meeting of soothing piano and passionate saxophone that is as immediate as it is eternal. Every note is precisely placed to complement the lyrics that map the contours of longing and regret without ever venturing into soap operatic territory.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1JNjn97PrqeLES2F563KvE?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>What is unique about this release is Antonio's use of technology for artistic purposes. Working with AI technology that assists with lyrics, Antonio combines his experiences with modern technology, creating a story that is specific, poignant, and meaningful. The combination of human emotion with technology assistance comes off as intentional rather than novelty-seeking, which is a testament to an artist open to innovation yet grounded in storytelling.<br><br>*Entre tes mains* is a prime example of a balance between vulnerability and complexity. The vocal performance of David is both delicate and refined, moving the story forward with a sense of truth. The interplay of the sax and piano creates a sense of grandeur to frame the song, drawing the listener into a space where the emotion can be experienced to the fullest. The arrangement of the song has a cinematic quality to it, much like a jazz ballad, yet it is very much rooted in the time it is created.<br><br>For those listeners who enjoy music which is both reflective and well-crafted, *Entre Tes Mains* will prove to be a compelling listen. The minimalistic recording style, combined with the innovative writing of lyrics, indicates a confident artist who isn’t afraid to take a different route. Antonio David remains a testament to the fact that songwriting from the heart and experimenting with technology do not have to be at odds. "Entre tes mains" is a highlight in his journey so far—a single that lingers long after its last note has faded away.</p>

<p class="align-center">Tony Frissore has always straddled worlds, and his current single, Four Walls, is an expression of this restless curiosity turned inward. Released in 2025 as the last installment of a seven-track set recorded on the road, Four Walls represents a moment of solitude—a feeling of being on the move but alone in your own company. It is a contemplative song but not a sad one, and it maintains its rhythmic pulse even as it explores intimacy.<br><br>As an artist, producer, and long-time aficionado of the genre, Tony’s own personal history is as diverse as the music he creates. From Boston to the jazz scene of New Orleans, and then on to the clubs of the European mainland to network with other DJs and nightclub owners, Tony’s global perspective is reflected in the diverse rhythms and elements of the many styles of music he weaves into his own works. Today, Tony is currently performing as the frontman for the Cleveland-based group Pop Avenue while pursuing his own solo career as an artist.<br><br>Four Walls is at a calmer crossroads of his sound. While tracks such as Just Fade Away and The Eagle Has Landed reach out with energetic urgency and directness, Four Walls looks inward, celebrating the feelings of being enclosed both physically and emotionally. This is a track whose production is full of the dynamics of both motion and stasis at the same time, with delicate electronics underscoring quiet reflection and fleeting memories in the midst of the rush of traveling. It's a track that is very filmic, like the view of the city through the window of a hotel room at night.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/09qTJTEgJU2ivPZhvPjZvD?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>Frissore’s work has international reach. His songs have been featured on MTV, Discovery, TLC, HGTV, OWN, and the DIY Network, and Shazammed in more than 150 countries, which shows a rare talent for speaking to everyone while still having a unique voice. *Four Walls*, on the other hand, is a very personal work. It shows a producer with the talent to create both public and private spaces.<br><br>This single is a product of his very productive 2025, in which he produced singles such as Know Yourself, Stand for Freedom, Self Soothe, and Bad Strategies. Through all of these, he is able to shift easily from one genre to another, whether it is EDM, hip-hop, or even the more contemplative down-tempo genre, with years of experience under his belt, from his earlier work in 2008 with The Übermix to his Quarantine Chronicles in 2020. However, Four Walls is unique in its simplicity and emotional depth.<br><br>Listeners familiar with Frissore’s discography will know his unique combination of groove, texture, and melody. Newcomers to his music will find a song that is both intimate and sophisticated, a song that is reflective while also having enough rhythmic propulsion to recall that it is music written by someone who understands the road, both physically and figuratively. "Four Walls" is a subtle gem in a vast discography. It is a reminder that in the midst of movement, sound, and the global, it is important to look inward, to observe, to listen, and to create a space where the world recedes and all that is left is the sound and the mind.</p>

<p class="align-center">"OH COME" slotted right in with the rest of Mann’s oeuvre, which extends over two decades and two dozen albums. Mann’s reputation for fusing various cultures and spiritual traditions into music that inspires without having to resort to showmanship in the process translates into a track like "OH COME," which presents a moment for introspection that is both contemporary and eternal.</p>

The strength of the song is in its subtlety: it is a song that invites the listener to pause, listen, and respond to the invitation to honor the season.<br><br>The gentle voice and production of Mann make the song as fitting for personal listening as it is for corporate worship, distilling the heart of the Christmas story without pretense. It is an important reminder that sometimes the most powerful moments of music and faith come through the power of spontaneity and simplicity.<br><br>What Eddy Mann has created with "Oh Come" is something far greater than a Christmas song; it is a musical moment which captures the quiet joys and reflections at the heart of the season. This is music which is certain to live on year after year as both celebration and meditation.</p>

<p class="align-center">Whiskey, Ghosts, and Memories does not hurry to get its point across. This six-track EP from Ron the Trucker has the tempo of one who has lived with these stories for long enough to understand that they are not going to fade away simply because you tell them once. This record, which has its foundations in country and Americana, has more of the feel of a chat that takes place late at night.<br><br>Right from the start, it is apparent that this record is intended to be listened to from start to finish. Each song segues nicely into the next, creating an imperfect but deliberate trajectory that follows love, loss, faith, and the quiet accounting of time. These songs are not ones intended to be listened to in isolation. They function best as chapters, each lending weight to those preceding it. In the end, the listener has not only absorbed these songs, but has inhabited an emotional space.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/218to8VPosk7vmuBroznOF?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>The writing in the songs of Ron the Trucker is steady and sure. His songs value clarity over cleverness; they state what they have to say directly and in a straightforward way. There is no flowery language in the songs of Ron the Trucker; the words are plain but not empty of meaning. Every word in the songs of Ron the Trucker seems to be well-earned. There is a definite sense of place in the songs of Ron the Trucker; not just physical place but also a sense of a place in the heart where the noise has receded.<br><br>The recording reflects that level of control. Everything is in its proper place, serving the tales rather than upstaging them. The guitars have a played-in quality. The beats are contemplative. Breathing room is given to exist between the phrases, allowing a word to sink in completely before the next idea comes along. It is a reminder of a day when country and Americana albums relied on the song to carry the load.<br><br>What’s most striking, however, is that these songs have a level of emotional realism that’s quite rare. “Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories” isn’t an album that tries to sentimentalize hardship or paper over regret. It’s one that lets faith and doubt occupy the same space. There’s loss, but not in a way that’s traumatic or dramatic. There’s love that’s complicated and lasting, not simplistic and absolute.<br><br>On a spiritual level, the EP fits right in with other minimalist albums by artists such as Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and other songwriters in more contemporary circles who prefer a narrative first approach. There’s a certain element to the record that resonates with films that exist in a state of dialogue over action, in which the meaning is found in the quiet instead of the loud.<br><br>Ron the Trucker’s biography is important. As an independent artist, Ron the Trucker’s work is influenced by long hours and hard work and the experiences of personal loss. His songs demonstrate an awareness of the world and its experiences. There is no hype. There is no downplaying. The songs flow as if you were having a discussion with someone who knows enough to talk carefully.<br><br>The fact that he has founded Broken Soul Records, LLC, in Georgia, and that it is a company that distributes his music, further emphasizes that it is not his intention to produce mainstream music. This artist definitely stands by his ideals of artistic expression and honesty, rather than striving to produce something refined and popular. Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is perfect for listeners who appreciate albums as a complete work, and not necessarily as a compilation of hooks. It will appeal to listeners of introspective country, singer-songwriter albums, and Americana that is based upon storytelling as opposed to spectacle. It is also perfect for playlists and environments where the emphasis is upon meaning and truth as opposed to sound. This EP doesn’t aim to change the world. It undertakes something much more subtle and much harder. It listens to itself and speaks out from it. This gives Ron the Trucker a record that has a solid, lived-in feel to it, and it rings true. If you are looking to hear music that understands the gravity of memories and the solace of telling the truth, then Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is certainly worth your time.</p>
