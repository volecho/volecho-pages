                <p class="align-center">Whiskey, Ghosts, and Memories does not hurry to get its point across. This six-track EP from Ron the Trucker has the tempo of one who has lived with these stories for long enough to understand that they are not going to fade away simply because you tell them once. This record, which has its foundations in country and Americana, has more of the feel of a chat that takes place late at night.<br><br>Right from the start, it is apparent that this record is intended to be listened to from start to finish. Each song segues nicely into the next, creating an imperfect but deliberate trajectory that follows love, loss, faith, and the quiet accounting of time. These songs are not ones intended to be listened to in isolation. They function best as chapters, each lending weight to those preceding it. In the end, the listener has not only absorbed these songs, but has inhabited an emotional space.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/218to8VPosk7vmuBroznOF?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>The writing in the songs of Ron the Trucker is steady and sure. His songs value clarity over cleverness; they state what they have to say directly and in a straightforward way. There is no flowery language in the songs of Ron the Trucker; the words are plain but not empty of meaning. Every word in the songs of Ron the Trucker seems to be well-earned. There is a definite sense of place in the songs of Ron the Trucker; not just physical place but also a sense of a place in the heart where the noise has receded.<br><br>The recording reflects that level of control. Everything is in its proper place, serving the tales rather than upstaging them. The guitars have a played-in quality. The beats are contemplative. Breathing room is given to exist between the phrases, allowing a word to sink in completely before the next idea comes along. It is a reminder of a day when country and Americana albums relied on the song to carry the load.<br><br>What’s most striking, however, is that these songs have a level of emotional realism that’s quite rare. “Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories” isn’t an album that tries to sentimentalize hardship or paper over regret. It’s one that lets faith and doubt occupy the same space. There’s loss, but not in a way that’s traumatic or dramatic. There’s love that’s complicated and lasting, not simplistic and absolute.<br><br>On a spiritual level, the EP fits right in with other minimalist albums by artists such as Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and other songwriters in more contemporary circles who prefer a narrative first approach. There’s a certain element to the record that resonates with films that exist in a state of dialogue over action, in which the meaning is found in the quiet instead of the loud.<br><br>Ron the Trucker’s biography is important. As an independent artist, Ron the Trucker’s work is influenced by long hours and hard work and the experiences of personal loss. His songs demonstrate an awareness of the world and its experiences. There is no hype. There is no downplaying. The songs flow as if you were having a discussion with someone who knows enough to talk carefully.<br><br>The fact that he has founded Broken Soul Records, LLC, in Georgia, and that it is a company that distributes his music, further emphasizes that it is not his intention to produce mainstream music. This artist definitely stands by his ideals of artistic expression and honesty, rather than striving to produce something refined and popular. Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is perfect for listeners who appreciate albums as a complete work, and not necessarily as a compilation of hooks. It will appeal to listeners of introspective country, singer-songwriter albums, and Americana that is based upon storytelling as opposed to spectacle. It is also perfect for playlists and environments where the emphasis is upon meaning and truth as opposed to sound. This EP doesn’t aim to change the world. It undertakes something much more subtle and much harder. It listens to itself and speaks out from it. This gives Ron the Trucker a record that has a solid, lived-in feel to it, and it rings true. If you are looking to hear music that understands the gravity of memories and the solace of telling the truth, then Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is certainly worth your time.</p>

                <p data-start="56" data-end="402">Joey P. closes out 2025 by tightening his focus rather than widening the frame. MISSING IN ACTION is a short release, just two tracks, but it says more about his current headspace than a full album might. After a year that included viral momentum and serious streaming numbers, this feels like a controlled step forward, confident and deliberate.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="56" data-end="402"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2a1dff70K0i5OZXBkYQOzZ?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p data-start="56" data-end="402"> </p>
<p data-start="404" data-end="968">Only One leans into clean pop instincts, polished vocals riding a smooth, bright production that recalls early Justin Bieber singles before pop fully blurred into EDM. It is catchy without trying too hard, the kind of track that slides easily onto radio playlists or late afternoon drives. Then comes Wrong With You, which shifts the lights down. The beat slows, the tone darkens, and Joey sinks back into R and B, letting space and restraint do the heavy lifting. His voice sits closer to the listener here, revealing cracks and questions rather than hooks alone.</p>
<p data-start="970" data-end="1387" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Production from Sandro Carr and Mr. Igotbars keeps both songs focused and modern, never cluttered. The contrast works because it feels honest. Fans of artists like Giveon, early The Weeknd, or Justin Timberlake’s moodier cuts will recognize the balance. MISSING IN ACTION plays like a short film with two scenes, one sunlit, one after midnight. It leaves you curious about what comes next, which is exactly the point.</p>

                <p>Wōndering on Giants embodies the tradition of songwriting while never being bound by it. With acoustic guitars, rhythmic patterns, and lyrics, it’s a contemplation of landscape and identity with a soothing voice. There’s a presence of the Highland landscape and the openness of Montana, but it’s not one of drama, just of quiet presence.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1VLm4Y8iiwM5ILONPrt9FP?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>The music is played with a sense of control. There are gentle weavings of guitars, and the keyboards and basses are complementary and do not compete with the other instruments. The rhythm section is driving the music at a comfortable tempo. The production is warm and has a real sense of being performed. It has the introspective feel of Nick Drake or John Martyn or Van Morrison at his earliest.<br><br>What is most apparent, though, is the songwriting emphasis. The lyrics are significant in these instances, conveying meaning in a way that doesn’t rely on the superfluous. There’s a feeling of cyclical time, a meeting of the past and the present in terms of vision.</p>
<p>Those listeners who respond to the records of the mid sixties through the seventies, for instance, will find a familiarity in this song that doesn’t rely on imitation.</p>

                <p>“Lost My Way Home” has a heavy calmness to it, one that relies more on atmosphere than spectacle. The Night Wolf-produced track establishes a cinematic feel, with the end and texture creating a broad, dark background. The vocal delivery by Lois Powell is direct and sincere, with no strain or emphasis on drama. While it's about accepting and persevering, it never comes across as preachy. Rather, it's an unfolding piece that relies on mood for storytelling.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2ZG439LjY39kjc6JcROx8l?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The trip hop beats are juxtaposed with alt-pop and ambiance, and it's a sound that's at once close and expansive. It wouldn't have been amiss in the company of Massive Attack, London Grammar, or the more subdued tracks by Portishead. There is definitely a sense of territory being staked out here, particularly with the start of the record label EscaVolt Records in association with the release. “Lost My Way Home” is definitely a declaration of intent – and it is a declaration that will immediately appeal to those with an interest in film scores and late night play lists. It is music that is like a scene in a film and not just a song.</p>

                <p>Martin Howard’s latest guitar solo sounds like the pause button on a remote control pressed at just the right time. Recorded on a fifty-year-old classical guitar, it has a warm and clean sound, each note ringing out fully before the next one comes. There is definitely a classical background to this writing, but it never sounds formal. Folk patterns and contemporary flourishes keep it earthed.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5f83vtRoIg611zufq6A6ID?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>With the music reflecting the calm radiance of the moonscape painting that inspired it, the performance contains itself enough to allow the melody to speak for itself. Howard knows how to say a lot through a little. It’s a technique that evokes memories of musicians like Michael Hedges or Ry Cooder from way back when, when the guitar was both the rhythm and the vocals.<br><br>In a market that is currently dominated by cover versions and background instrumentals, Howard's commitment to creating new nylon string music is almost welcome. This is music that is better suited to quiet listening environments and is something that could sit alongside the scores by Gustavo Santaolalla or the more subdued sections of classical crossover albums. It is possible to create something emotively resonant with less.<br><br></p>

                <p>John Beckmann approaches “The Mortal Prophets” more like a musical entity than a band. Every record is more about atmosphere and setting, with songs playing like episodes from short stories that take place on the highways of the desert or in dimly lit rooms. “Americana” is there, but it’s not nostalgic. It’s like the guitars are worn, the voices are drifting, and the electronic elements are sneaking into the corners.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3Y2UzZ6Uelgt7zmIuWlZ6R?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>Beckmann’s prose is strongly suggestive. The lyrics draw on mysticism, poetry, and late-night trains of thought, leaving room for interpretation. You can hear nods towards Eno and Fripp in the ambient textures, the constant propulsion of kosmische music beneath it all, and glimmers of Pink Floyd in their earlier incarnation in the melodic lines. But it all comes down with a sense of clarity, never succumbing to abstraction for abstraction’s sake.<br><br>For anyone who likes artists such as Nick Cave, David Sylvian, or the darker side of Talk Talk, there is plenty to immerse oneself in here. The Mortal Prophets are a group whose sounds are perhaps better digested slowly, perhaps late at night, in the same way you might view an old film noir or a well-worn novel.<br><br></p>

                <p>Plague Protocol has the sound of a record recorded under a black sky, loud enough to drown out all else. Deathkrush embraces the weight and the size on this record, crafting tracks that have a physicality about them but never losing their form in the process. The guitars churn and writhe, low and thick, a body of tension that never abates. The drumming toggles from all-out sprint to crushing weight, imbuing the record with a vital, organic pulse that keeps the listener on the end of the next beat.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/326lQhg79XzAN3MBXpbsYs?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>The vocals enter with a wash, screaming abrasively against deep, guttural rumbles. There isn’t a sense of frontman swagger, but rather a sense of multiple voices intersecting, ritualistic and feral. Lyrics find Plague Protocol circles collapse, both internal and cosmic, describing destruction as both terrifying and transformative. It recalls the weight of early Gojira, the drama of Fit for an Autopsy, and the bleak scope of contemporary deathcore, but doesn’t derive from any one source.<br><br>This is not background music. *Plague Protocol* requires attention, just as with other movies such as *Road* or *Children of Men*, which immerse you in a pessimistic atmosphere that lingers with you. Listeners seeking something heavy yet well-thought-out rather than just thrown together will appreciate what Deathkrush has to offer.</p>

                <p class="align-center" data-start="61" data-end="492"><strong>Mike Vorpal Turns Gloom Into Glow on House of Capricorn</strong></p>
<p data-start="61" data-end="492">Mike Vorpal writes songs that feel lived in, like rooms you remember long after you have left the lights on. House of Capricorn, a standout from his debut solo EP Memes, leans hard into that feeling. From its first guitar strike, the track settles into a tense push and pull between dark wave moodiness and sharp, physical guitar lines. It moves with intent but never rushes, letting each sound breathe just enough to leave a mark.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="61" data-end="492"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4tHVeF6F9HjqAnDe2uBToE?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p data-start="494" data-end="935">Vorpal’s production work is confident without being flashy. Synth lines hum beneath the surface, tangled with rough-edged guitars that sound scraped rather than polished. The result feels close and wide at the same time, like standing alone in a crowded club while the band locks into something heavy and hypnotic. His vocals stay low and open, carrying a quiet weight that suggests things left unsaid, thoughts circling rather than landing.</p>
<p data-start="937" data-end="1281">House of Capricorn rewards repeat listens. Small shifts in rhythm and melody creep up on you, echoing the slow burn of records by artists like Interpol, early The National, or the more shadowed moments of Depeche Mode. There is also a cinematic pull here, the kind that would sit comfortably beside late night scenes from Drive or Donnie Darko.</p>
<p data-start="1283" data-end="1481" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Memes as a whole confirms Vorpal as an artist who understands restraint and tension. This is music for night drives, empty rooms, and anyone who finds comfort in songs that linger rather than shout.</p>
