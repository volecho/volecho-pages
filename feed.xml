                <p><br>Ava Renn bursts onto the scene with Lightning Child like someone is kicking open a door that was never intended to be closed in the first place. The single and videos feel restless, loud, and alive, much like the pulse of an artist who is starting to trust her instincts, instincts she has honed since childhood. This is rock music with grit beneath its nails.<br><br>Not at all production-ready in their production values, the music grew in the West Texas desert, and you can tell by the silences between the sounds. The guitars are scratchy and thunderous, the drums drive hard, and Ava’s singing is front and center, fractured in spots, unwavering in others, but always legitimate. There’s an element that pays homage to PJ Harvey’s early albums in spots and an underlying intensity from the 90s punk revival set to slower laments that temporarily let the emotion sink in. Consider it the difference between horror films like Natural Born Killers or early Sofia Coppola in which mood trumps all else.</p>

<p><br><br>What’s particularly noticeable is the production decision not to smooth out anything. Everything is left bare. These songs are left to speak for themselves, and they do. This is music that will appeal to anyone who likes artists such as Courtney Barnett, or Hole, or possibly even St. Vincent from her earlier work.<br><br>Ava Renn<br>Lightning Child is not a consoling album. It’s an album of reclaimed space, noise, and electricity that gets to run wherever it pleases. Ava Renn appears to be ready to continue pushing, and it’s important to listen before the sparks are lit in something bigger.</p>

                <p>On Point of No Return, the music of Dizzy Panda positions itself firmly in a place of tension instead of comfort, and this is what permeates an album that is electric and deliberate. The Haarlem duo have always revelled in genre-hopping, but what comes out here is a fully cinematic and charged record. Pulsing electronica presses against dreamy jazz chords, retro synth sounds flicker in and out of the picture, and a sense of nervous energy hums along below the surface. At the heart of this album beats a heavy and straightforward question – what does it mean to be authentic when technology is also at work?</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2NpvjxVmyqxArOUBoF7oyv?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>The sound production is deliberate and doesn’t sound like it’s trying too hard. The tracks progress at a gentle pace that lets the silence speak for itself. The beats click and then retreat. The melodies sound like they’re from a familiar place but recalled from a distance away. There’s a tug-of-war between warmth and removal that echoes the feeling found in the cinematic aesthetics of things like Ex Machina or early seasons of Black Mirror.<br><br>The masked aesthetic works well with their music. On the surface, it's playful—at times even cartoonish—but the more time you spend looking at it, the creepier it gets. This kind of juxtaposition happens all over their album. Those into artists such as Moderat, the more electronic side projects of Radiohead, or the darker side of Air will discover much about which they feel strongly. Regardless of what background music Point of No Return would make in a crowded market, it demands your complete focus.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="68"><strong>The Widows Stir The Dark Corners Of London Rock With 'Bardo Blues'</strong><br><br>The Widows have been haunting the edges of London's musical fringes for almost a decade, oozing through post-punk grit, psych haze, and straight-up rock with the kind of confidence that comes from not being bothered by whatever people may call them. Bardo Blues marks one of their sharper returns-a track that might rattle a pub window while it simultaneously pulls you into its trance. It lands with snarling guitars, a rhythm section that stays tight even when everything else swings wild, Kim Le Tan's voice shifting from velvet to venom without warning.<br><br>The band's history has always been a little chaotic. Forming in 2015, they'd release cult favorites like Popular Demand and the brilliantly blunt Brexit Chainstore Massacre. Then their drummer vanished and everything paused. Their 2023 re-arrival with a refreshed lineup feels a bit like the start of a new chapter in some sort of punk comic book. The energy remains unfiltered, but the focus is keener. Imagine early Stooges attitude with flickering glimpses of wiry guitar lines from Television or maybe that one crooked groove you'd find yourself falling into on some Cramps deep cut.<br><br>Bardo Blues carries that crooked grin, rolling out like the soundtrack to a lost David Lynch bar scene. It packs the mood of bands like Fat White Family and Goat Girl but with more shadow and a little more swagger. The Widows thrive in that space between control and chaos, where a song might veer off the tracks only to slam back into place on the next beat. If you like films where the neon flickers and something strange hums in the background, or records that feel like they were taped in a room with too much smoke and not enough sleep, this is well worth your time. Put on Bardo Blues, then go back to their older work and let the whole thing wash over you. It hits like a late night walk through Camden when you're not quite sure if you should be thrilled or worried. Either way, it keeps you looking over your shoulder.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="46"><strong>Judith Owen Swings Back Into the Spotlight</strong><br><br>Judith Owen approaches music with the kind of spark that makes you lean in, and her return with Judith Owen Swings Christmas feels both like a warm reunion and a reminder of how much character she brings to jazz. The Wales-born, New Orleans-based singer has long balanced sharp humor with emotional depth, and her holiday record captures that mix with a glow that suits winter nights. Her phrasing has that sly charm you hear in old Rosemary Clooney cuts, but the production carries a tight modern snap. It's the sort of album you put on while cooking late, the kind that pairs nicely with a rewatch of The Holiday or even the cozy chaos of classic Nora Ephron films.<br><br>Owen is working toward a new full-length in early 2026, and the excitement building makes perfect sense. Come On and Get It, her tribute to the fierce women of the forties and fifties, earned wide praise for good reason: She approached those songs with affection but also a fresh sense of character-the way Amy Winehouse once reshaped the past without straining for effect. Underneath it all sits a personal story marked by early loss, years of uncertainty, and a steady push toward joy. She's spoken publicly about anxiety and depression, and that honesty gives her work a grounded tone that keeps sentiment from turning sugary.<br><br>Her collaboration with David Torkanowsky and a circle of New Orleans players keeps the arrangements lively without losing focus. Owen shines brightest when she leans into the cool swing of the band, riding the rhythm the way Julie London once did, half whisper and half wink. It's easy to imagine fans of Madeleine Peyroux or Chet Baker drifting toward her catalogue, or even listeners who lean toward intimate film soundtracks like In the Mood for Love.<br><br>What really makes this phase of her career striking is how self-assured she sounds. There's humor, there's fire, and the sense of someone fully at ease with her quirks and instincts. With Helen Mirren and Jennifer Coolidge among her cheering section of admirers, she has that energy of the artist not trying to impress anyone but simply to tell stories with clarity and heart. Her next chapter is set up to be one of her strongest yet, and if the new album expands on this spirit, then fans of classic jazz vocals are in for a treat.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="46"><strong>Paul Louis Villani Breaks the Floorboards With Sound That Leaves a Mark</strong><br><br>Paul Louis Villani is not here to make background music. His new work hits with the force of something restless and sharp-the kind of sound that cuts through whatever you were thinking about a moment before. The Melbourne producer has always moved across styles, pulling from funk, metal, hip hop, and art rock-yet he treats each influence like raw clay. Nothing feels neat. Nothing feels gentle. His track Quit Bleeding All Over the Floor is a good entry point. It rolls forward with bass that lands like a warning and vocals which press close without apology. A Spotify link is out there for anyone brave enough to jump in. The forthcoming record Fully Unchained Creativity, Kinetically Overriding Fossilised Frameworks, due November 2025, pushes this mood even harder. It sounds like someone tearing down a room in the dark just to see what might take shape next. If you're into Death Grips, early Nine Inch Nails, or the rougher edges of Sleaford Mods, there'll be something for you here to chew on. Any gloss gets stripped away by the video that sits with the single. Bodies twitch and twist across the frame, all nerves and sharp angles, like a dance piece inspired by a panic attack scene from Black Swan. No plot, no soft landing, just motion driven by tension. Villani treats sound like a living creature with teeth, and it's precisely that which makes his work so compelling. It reminds you that the music can still provoke if the artist is willing to risk discomfort. This is not safe listening. It is far more interesting than that.</p>

<p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong data-start="204" data-end="277">JD Days Bring Heart, Humor, and Big-Screen Warmth to the Holidays with 'Christmas Anthology'<br></strong><br>JD Days get into the festive spirit with the Christmas Anthology, a record that feels like someone took the classic Christmas album format, fed it through a storyteller's mind, and tied the whole thing together with the glow of a winter cinema trip. The UK collective, led by singer-songwriter James, mix pop-rock, folk, and clean melodic writing with short 3D animated films for every track. It gives the project the spirit of an old-school holiday movie night, the sentimental kind that sits somewhere between early Pixar, The Snowman, and the rom-com charm of something like Serendipity.<br><br>Across the ten tracks, the group move through snowy New York streets, a loud-and-loose rock tune about Santa in full reckless mode, and softer songs that sit closer to candlelight. Six originals hold the emotional weight and four familiar classics are rebuilt with a light touch. It never tips into sugar overload. Instead it works like a series of small stories about forgiveness and second chances, the sort of themes that power everything from It's A Wonderful Life to the quieter moments in modern Christmas films like Klaus.<br><br>JD Days writes with a sincerity that sounds rare in seasonal music. There's warmth, but there's an understanding, too, that winter brings with it its own heaviness. James said that the aim was to make work that can light the dark, and that tone carries through every track. The arrangements lean on clear acoustic textures, lifting choruses, small bursts of choral color, and enough pop bite to keep each song from drifting into background cheer. The animation adds another layer. Nothing fancy for the sake of it, just stories that pair well with the music. Think of the way Gorillaz use visuals to deepen a song, but swap the surreal edge for something gentler and more festive.<br><br>For listeners who enjoy the heartfelt tone of She &amp; Him's holiday records, the warmth of Taylor Swift's Christmas Tree Farm, or even the nostalgic tug of old Specials like The Muppet Christmas Carol, there's an easy entry point here. At its best, Christmas Anthology plays like a gentle reminder that seasonal music needn't be disposable: it can be tender without being soft, bright without turning brittle, and playful without losing its point.<br><br>More than anything, this release treats Christmas as a time when people try again. Songs move through love, regret, small triumphs, and the hope the season can mend what the year has strained. It is a record made with care, built on simple human themes rather than heavy gloss. JD Days offer something warm enough for a long car ride home, steady enough for late-night wrapping sessions, and rich enough for anyone who still wants holiday music to mean something.<strong data-start="204" data-end="277"><br><br></strong></p>

<p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong data-start="204" data-end="277">KTLM Creates Noise the Algorithms Can't Touch<br><br></strong>KTLМ is the kind of project that feels born from a late-night group chat gone rogue, then somehow turned into a full-scale art attack. This Russian-speaking collective pushes anti-war messages through satire, glitchy visuals, and sound jumping styles as if trying to outrun the Internet itself: punk, folk, rap, noise, cartoon chaos-whatever works. The point is to keep the listener awake, not comfy. In a digital world shaped by metrics and engineered attention spans, they stand out for breaking every rule and doing it with a grin.<br><br>The group clues into something many artists whisper about but few address: how algorithms flatten everything they touch. KTLM fights back with content that refuses to sit still. A track might kick off like a Soviet punk bootleg before spinning into a beat that hints at early Gorillaz or the oddball charm of Daniel Johnston animations. Their characters pop up like NPCs from some fever-dream video game, all pushing the same idea that war and propaganda turn people into spectators when they should be calling the whole thing out.<br><br>What makes KTLM interesting is the streak of real heart running underneath all the chaos: you hear flashes of longing in the folk melodies and flashes of rage in the noise breaks. It's a mix that recalls the sharp wink of Monty Python, the rough edges of Pussy Riot, and the surreal punch of Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's messy in the right way. The live show, currently in development, promises the same unruly mood. Imagine a gig that leaps between theatre, protest, and late-night cable weirdness, each one delivered from a cast of artists who want to snap you out of the lull of passive scrolling. It may confuse a few people, and that's part of the charm. KTLM may never sit high on an algorithmic chart, but that's the point. They work for the humans still paying attention, the ones who want art that actually says something. In a world where so much feels flattened, their noise feels like a genuine refusal to make peace with the norm.</p>

<p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong>A Light In Motion: Eternal Tone Pushes Through The Static With Kodaks</strong><br><br>Eternal Tone's music is like an attempt to keep the flame alive in strong winds, and that comes across readily on Kodaks. The Kansas artist pulls Hip Hop, Rap, and RnB into a smooth, melodic swing that never feels rushed. The hook lands with a slow burn, the verses feel lived in, and the beat settles into a warm, late-night pulse that recalls the patience of early Chance tapes or the reflective side of Saba. There's quiet confidence to the way the track builds, a sense that Tone knows the weight of every line before it leaves his chest.<br><br>What gives Kodaks its pull is the grounding force behind it. The song isn't out to posture; it's closer to the mix of faith and grit you hear in artists who grew up with both struggle and hope in the same room. Tone sings and raps like someone who has spent long nights sorting through old memories, then decided to turn them into something that carries light. There's a bit of Cudi's raw heart, a touch of Khalid's softness, and the Midwest's steady calm shaping the edges.<br><br>Listeners who lean toward the warmth of Giveon or the reflective glow of Isaiah Rashad will find something familiar here, but Kodaks never feels like it is tracing anyone else's lines. Tone gives the track a mood that feels wide open, like the final shot of a film where the camera pulls back over a quiet town and you're left with the sense that someone inside one of those houses just chose a different path.<br><br>If you stack it next to films like Moonlight or The Pursuit of Happyness, it shares that same sense of flickering strength-the subtle kind that grows in silence and then hits when the moment lands. One writes from that space: hard days, wrong turns, small victories, small losses, and a stubborn belief that all these can shape something better.<br><br>Beyond the single, Eternal Tone frames his whole catalog as a place where people can rest for a minute. He talks openly about wanting his work to feel like a small refuge, and you hear that in the soft production touches and the way his voice breaks slightly at the edges. He isn't offering perfection, just honesty. That is often far harder to find.<br><br>Kodaks feels like a marker in the story of an artist who isn't in any hurry, building piece by piece, as Midwest creators do. There's room here for anyone who likes their music steady, heartfelt, and free from noise. It's the kind of track you play when driving nowhere on purpose, or when the day has been too much and you need someone to tell the truth without raising their voice.<br><br>Eternal Tone may still be rising, but Kodaks shows he already knows how to turn his past into fuel. The song glows with quiet intention, and if his future work stays this tuned in, it won't be long before his name sits next to artists who shaped him. For now, Kodaks stands on its own as a reminder that sound hits hardest when it comes from a place that's still learning, still growing, still trying, and still shining through the static.<br><br></p>

<p data-start="204" data-end="277"><strong>Jax Fleming finds his voice in raw, late-night tangles of memory and noise.</strong><br><br>Jax Fleming's debut EP, I'll Be Fine, lands like a quiet confession pushed through an amp turned just past safe. The six tracks feel close to the skin, built from moments he lived-not ones he staged. You can hear the hands behind it too, since he played nearly everything himself. That choice gives the whole record a warm, rough edge, the kind you get from someone figuring things out in real time and refusing to polish the truth out of it.<br><br>Raised outside Henderson, Kentucky, Jax chased something bigger from the moment a grainy festival video of 30 Seconds to Mars lit a spark in him. He carried that fire through his years fronting Atlas of the Dogs, playing big rooms around southern Indiana, before shaving off the frontman gloss and stepping into something closer to the kid he was. The slacker 90s clothes, the honest mess, the way the songs fall between grunge, indie, and heartache, all of it fits. HiLo, the lead track from the EP, twists between two moods: one minute loose and breezy, with a soft rock sway; the next, it kicks into a sharper guitar run that hits harder with each listen. It sounds like someone being pulled along by a love they can’t quite hold steady, which makes it easy to line up next to coming-of-age films like Perks of Being a Wallflower or the early scenes of Almost Famous. Macie pulls from that same part of his heart, tying teenage memories to the present in ways that never feel forced. Accordingly, fans of Dayglow, early Cage the Elephant, or even the softer side of Smashing Pumpkins will find much to hang onto here. The EP plays like a season of someone's life-the late night parts, at any rate. Jax and producer Wes Luttrell built something that sits between regret and relief, that place where you take a breath and tell yourself it's fine, even when you're not sure yet. And somehow, that honesty hits harder than anything louder could.</p>

</article>
<p class="sr-only"><br>Michellar's new album feels like a long breath finally released. REVERIE .FROM THEN TILL NOW carries the weight of years spent quiet, only to return with songs that glow like porch lights on a late summer night. You can hear the imprint of her early influences in the songwriting craft, the gentle sway of James Taylor, the steady warmth of Carole King, the folk calm of Peter Paul and Mary. But the record never sounds stuck in memory. Instead, it plays like someone stepping back into the room with a clear voice and a sharper sense of what matters.<br><br>Raised in a music-soaked home and later rooted in the San Francisco scene, Michellar wrote her first songs at fifteen, then put the guitar down for four decades while she built a life in landscape design. The spark hit again in 2023, when one acceptance letter from the deYoung Museum quietly rearranged everything. Since then, she has written at a pace that feels almost instinctive: dropping more than twenty singles in nine months, shaping a full album that holds tight to both quiet reflection and a renewed drive.<br><br>The songs on REVERIE move with steady confidence, guided by soft acoustic textures and lyrics that feel honest rather than polished. There's no attempt to hide the years she spent growing outside of music. If anything, those years deepen the record, giving it the tone of someone who knows how it feels to return to an old love and recognize its pull instantly. It pairs well with records like Joni Mitchell's Blue and Aimee Mann's Lost in Space or even the quieter moments of Boygenius, where simple lines land with surprising clarity.<br><br>The knowing calm of Michellar's writing echoes an intent behind every word, birthed from life lived. REVERIE demands no attention; it earns it-one song at a time-via its soft strength and steadfast spirit.</p>

                <p>Since its debut back in 2016, Stranger Things has loomed over Netflix like a neon-lit monolith, so nobody expected its farewell to be subtle. Instead, the series makes its final bow as if stepping onto a glowing '80s stage: in three dramatic acts tailored to stretch anticipation, fuel subscription spikes, and feed the wild churn of fan speculation. The first four episodes dropped, the next three arrive wrapped like a Christmas gift, and a two-hour finale is due to ring in New Year's Eve. For viewers in North America, the endgame even hits the silver screen-a bold, almost retro flourish suggesting the show has evolved far beyond mere "event television."<br><br>And honestly, based on the expansive first volume, the cinema treatment feels less like a stunt and more like a natural evolution. Three of the episodes run at feature length, the fourth nearly so, and every frame glows with the kind of craftsmanship you can feel - right down to the gloriously crimped perms and unapologetic mullets. Rumours that the Duffer Brothers were armed with $60 million per episode suddenly seem less like gossip and more like fact.<br><br>Spoilers remain as hazardous as a stroll through the Upside Down, but here’s a safe glimpse: the story leaps ahead to 1987, a year and a half after the explosive events of season four. Hawkins’ tight-knit band of teens is now bracing for their ultimate confrontation with Vecna, whose eerie calm and sharpened supernatural menace make him even more unsettling than before. Meanwhile, our heroine Jane “Eleven” Hopper trains with the gritty determination of an ’80s underdog hero—much to the anxious dismay of Joyce and Hopper, now united in their parental worry.<br><br>Around them, deeply human threads continue to ground the high-concept chaos. Dustin staggers under the grief of losing Eddie, the metalhead friend who became a season-four legend. Robin quietly faces the fears and freedoms of stepping into her own identity. Their struggles unfold against a lovingly rendered ’80s backdrop in which details matter, from Tiffany’s 1987 hit “I Think We’re Alone Now,” which becomes an emotional heartbeat in episode three, to Linda Hamilton, an icon of the era, arriving in a sly, meta casting twist as the enigmatic Dr. Kay. Volume one may feel like the first course to the season’s greater feast, but it still pulses with the show’s trademark blend of spectacle, sincerity, and supernatural thrill. Few shows feel like they have the kind of staying power to wholly upend your world after nearly a decade; Stranger Things is one of them.</p>

                <p>Oasis' longtime live keyboardist has lifted the curtain on what life was really like behind the scenes of the band's massive reunion tour—and weighed in on whether fans should expect another run of shows in 2026.<br><br>In August 2024, the Gallagher brothers sent shockwaves through the music world by announcing Live ’25, their first tour together in 16 years. What followed was a whirlwind: a triumphant run of UK dates; a globe-spanning schedule; and a final, explosive encore in São Paulo on November 23. By the end, the reunited Britpop giants had played 41 shows across 142 days - an odyssey as chaotic as it was historic.<br><br>Now, keyboardist Christian Madden has shared his own reflections in a candid Substack post, calling the experience from what he jokingly calls "the humble perspective of the least famous person in the most famous band trotting the globe this year." For him, this past year was nothing short of unforgettable.<br><br>But of course, the real question everyone wants to know is: how did Liam and Noel actually get along? Madden dispels the cynicism. "Yes, they did," he writes. It wasn't an exaggerated dynamic for cameras and fans, just two brothers being "genuinely warm" after years of tension, rebuilding a relationship cautiously. "What you saw was real."<br><br><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/oasis-keyboard-player-shares-details-on-liam-and-noel-gallaghers-relationship-on-reunion-tour-and-if-there-will-be-new-dates-in-2026-3913939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He also remembers the tour's crowds and singles out the second night in Buenos Aires as a true high point-an explosion of energy after an hour-plus wait caused by safety checks.</a><br><br>As far as rumors of new dates in 2026 go, however, Madden keeps expectations in check. “I get asked that a lot,” he says. When it comes to any future plans for the Gallaghers, though, he jests that he's hardly in the know: "Do you honestly think I know? I'm a worker ant when all's said and done."</p>

<p>Pointe's single Guard Rails arrives with the kind of quiet tension that holds your attention before you've even registered why. The Brisbane group are still only twenty, yet carry themselves with a depth that speaks to long nights in tiny rehearsal rooms and more than a few conversations about the songs that changed their lives. Guard Rails sits in that uneasy space before a major life shift, where dread lingers longer than the leap itself. Rose Fogarty puts that weight into her voice, soft but firm, as though sorting through the fear in real time.<br><br>What the band builds under her feels both angular and tender. Evander Adams Post shapes the pulse with a steady hand, Jude Spann's bass moves with intent, and Jake Park's guitar lines thread themselves in like a series of quiet questions. The track opens up slowly, then pulls tight again, recalling the cold edge of Interpol and the emotional clarity of The Cranberries. Paul Blakey's mastering gives the song clean space, the kind that lets small details hit with extra force.<br><br>Rooms at The Cave Inn have already been filled with Pointe, and the run of local dates would suggest their following will only grow. This debut hints at a full EP that could live comfortably next to early Daughter, the moodier moments of Wolf Alice, or even the dim neon glow of a Gregg Araki soundtrack. Guard Rails feels like the start of a band learning how to turn fear into something melodic, something honest, and something that sticks around long after the final note fades.</p>

<h2 class="align-left" data-start="13216" data-end="13264"><strong data-start="13219" data-end="13262">Wotts — Soft Lies in a Psychedelic Glow</strong></h2>
<p class="align-left" data-start="13279" data-end="13700">Ottawa’s indie-pop duo Wotts return with <em data-start="13320" data-end="13346">He Spoke With Conviction</em>, a track that drifts through the speakers like a half-remembered dream. Jayem and Ricky 100 lean into their earlier psychedelic instincts here, letting lo-fi warmth and soft, analog shimmer carry a story that unfolds gently but cuts deeply. The result feels like waking up mid-daydream—colors blurred, details softened, emotions sharper than expected.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="13702" data-end="14256">At its core, the song explores the lies we tell ourselves—the small, comforting untruths that help us make it through stretches where life feels heavier than usual. It’s introspective without being bleak, reflective without sinking. Jayem’s production builds a world of drifting synths, warm guitars, and textures that sound dusted in sunlight. Meanwhile, Ricky 100 keeps the track grounded with a bassline that refuses to overcrowd the mood. Together, they create a sense of hazy forward motion, like navigating a familiar street through shifting fog.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="14258" data-end="14602">Fans of early Tame Impala, Pond, Homeshake, or Mild High Club will immediately recognize the psychedelic contouring: the VHS-tinted synths, the softened edges, the dreamy pacing that feels almost weightless. It’s the kind of track that would sit easily in the more reflective scenes of <em data-start="14544" data-end="14554">Euphoria</em>, where the world tilts but never fully slips.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="14604" data-end="15021"><em data-start="14604" data-end="14630">He Spoke With Conviction</em> serves as a gateway to Wotts’ upcoming EP <em data-start="14673" data-end="14679">COPE</em>, which follows their emotionally heavier previous effort, <em data-start="14738" data-end="14746">FLANK!</em> If that record dealt with what breaks you, <em data-start="14790" data-end="14796">COPE</em> lingers in the space after the dust settles—when you try to move forward but aren’t sure your feet are steady yet. Wotts don’t offer fixes; they offer reflection, and it’s that honesty that makes this new chapter resonate.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="15023" data-end="15340">The single releases November 21, with a video arriving a week later, and if the EP carries this balance of warmth and unease, Wotts may land one of their most affecting projects yet. This is music for late-night thinkers, quiet mornings, and anyone learning the difference between letting go and simply continuing on.</p>
<h2 class="align-left" data-start="15347" data-end="15423"><strong data-start="15350" data-end="15421">Luka &amp; the Nightbirds — Last Resort and the Weight of Starting Over</strong></h2>
<p class="align-left" data-start="15438" data-end="16004">From Metz comes Luka &amp; the Nightbirds, a project built from a lifetime of musical immersion and a recent shift toward rawer, more human storytelling. Luka grew up listening to Chopin, Debussy, Duke Ellington, and The Beatles—absorbing classical clarity and jazz looseness before falling fully in love with <em data-start="15744" data-end="15756">Abbey Road</em> at six years old. His early solo career with Mercury and Universal brought chart success with tracks like “Rêves polyesters” and “Je ne pars pas sans toi,” but his newest phase with the Nightbirds feels more lived-in, more vulnerable, more real.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="16006" data-end="16569">Their lead single <em data-start="16024" data-end="16033">Vertigo</em>, from the forthcoming album <em data-start="16062" data-end="16075">Last Resort</em>, is a gentle emotional exhale. It’s a song about loss—acknowledged but not indulged—carried by Luka’s grounded, unforced vocal delivery and a band that understands the power of letting a moment breathe. Recorded live at Angie Studio in rural Cantal, <em data-start="16326" data-end="16335">Vertigo</em> holds the warmth and small imperfections of real rooms, real breaths, real people. That openness recalls the stark honesty of Bruce Springsteen’s <em data-start="16482" data-end="16492">Nebraska</em> or the quiet emotional cracks that make Big Thief’s recordings feel alive.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="16571" data-end="17016">There’s a cinematic quality to the track too, though not one painted in widescreen drama. Instead, it evokes those late-night scenes in films like <em data-start="16718" data-end="16739">Lost in Translation</em>, where the world softens and meaning slips in sideways. Luka writes like someone who has weathered storms and no longer tries to polish the rough edges away. The Nightbirds follow suit, shaping an atmosphere that holds emotional weight without squeezing it into neat shapes.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="17018" data-end="17453">Fans of The National, Ben Howard, or the softer corners of Wilco will recognize the blend of melancholy and gentle propulsion. <em data-start="17145" data-end="17158">Last Resort</em> arrives November 14, 2025, and if <em data-start="17193" data-end="17202">Vertigo</em> is a clue, the album will carry the bruises of a hard year while still letting small sparks shine through. This is music built from experience rather than performance—a reminder that beginning again rarely looks clean but can sound profoundly honest.</p>
<h2 class="align-left" data-start="17460" data-end="17524"><strong data-start="17463" data-end="17522">Mad Morning — The Circle and the Sound of Breaking Free</strong></h2>
<p class="align-left" data-start="17539" data-end="17992">Essex trio Mad Morning are done easing into anything. After the explosive impact of their debut <em data-start="17635" data-end="17647">Painkiller</em>, they return with <em data-start="17666" data-end="17678">The Circle</em>, a track that kicks its way into the room with sharp edges, louder instincts, and a restless energy that feels ripped straight from modern life’s accelerating churn. Their blend of post-grunge abrasion and indie hard-rock bite evokes the punch of early Alice in Chains meeting the tight ferocity of Royal Blood.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="17994" data-end="18542">The song digs into the cycles that trap us—financial grind, control, pressure, the endless race to keep pace while losing what matters. Rob Jarvis delivers lines like “take the money, I’ll keep my pride” with the dry grin of someone calling out the rat race while running through it. Kevin Hein’s drumming hits like a steel beam dropped from height, and the guitars slice with a jagged precision reminiscent of Velvet Revolver or the darker corners of Soundgarden. It’s a track built for Friday nights, sweat, and rooms that vibrate at the edges.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="18544" data-end="19129">What makes Mad Morning’s momentum so striking is how quickly their live presence caught fire. Before releasing a single piece of recorded music, they were already selling out venues like The Black Heart in Camden and The Waiting Room in Stoke Newington, with fans shouting lyrics that didn’t technically exist yet. Jarvis, seasoned from his years in the U.S., sings with the urgency of someone on his third or fourth reinvention. Hein, with his German metal-scene roots, plays with force and surgical consistency. Together, they compress stadium-scale energy into a three-piece roar.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="19131" data-end="19433">If <em data-start="19134" data-end="19146">Painkiller</em> was the spark, <em data-start="19162" data-end="19174">The Circle</em> is the ignition. Fans of Foo Fighters, Royal Blood, or the heavier edge of Queens of the Stone Age will latch on instantly. The track feels built for needle-drop moments in gritty films—the neon rush of <em data-start="19378" data-end="19385">Drive</em> or the explosive tension of <em data-start="19414" data-end="19430">Peaky Blinders</em>.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="19435" data-end="19644">With <em data-start="19440" data-end="19452">The Circle</em> out October 31 via Saviour Music, Mad Morning establish themselves as one of the UK’s most dangerous new rock prospects. Loud, sharp, and unwilling to compromise—they’re just getting started.</p>

<h2 data-start="19651" data-end="19707"><strong data-start="19654" data-end="19705">Allegra — Red and the Birth of an Adult-Pop Era</strong></h2>
<p data-start="19708" data-end="19720">London’s Allegra steps into a new chapter with <em data-start="19769" data-end="19774">Red</em>, a track that signals a clear shift from youthful dance-pop toward a deeper, darker, more self-possessed sound. Fresh off a #1 on the <em data-start="19909" data-end="19921">Music Week</em> Commercial Pop Chart with <em data-start="19948" data-end="19958">Wildfire</em>, she arrives here with unmistakable confidence—no longer leaning on momentum, but defining her path. <em data-start="20060" data-end="20065">Red</em>, the first glimpse of her upcoming second EP, moves on a deep, slow-burning bassline, airy synths, and vocals that hover between a whisper and a challenge. It’s intimate, late-night, and tinged with emotional weight beneath the sheen.</p>
<p data-start="20304" data-end="20702">The visualiser doubles down on that new identity. Allegra alternates between stark white and pulsing red, her performance measured and magnetic. The choreography is crisp enough for TikTok loops, yet the overall atmosphere feels more like the smoldering minimalism of a Dua Lipa cut or the mood-drenched glow of early <em data-start="20622" data-end="20632">Euphoria</em> sequences. It’s a reinvention—one shaped carefully but confidently.</p>
<p data-start="20704" data-end="21221">The full EP outlines the arc of someone stepping into adulthood in real time. <em data-start="20782" data-end="20787">Ash</em> lingers in a reflective haze, <em data-start="20818" data-end="20830">Slow Dance</em> blends warmth with club-friendly clarity, <em data-start="20873" data-end="20884">Waterfall</em> drifts breezily, and <em data-start="20906" data-end="20924">Love Me A Little</em> stands as the emotional centerpiece: tender, stripped-back, honest. Alongside them, <em data-start="21009" data-end="21019">Upgraded</em> balances sadness with lift, while <em data-start="21054" data-end="21062">Refund</em> channels the bite of a breakup anthem meant to be shouted with friends. Together, the tracklist forms a narrative of transition—messy, thrilling, and human.</p>
<p data-start="21223" data-end="21656">Allegra’s rise has been steady but substantial. Collaborations with Tiësto, Alok, Tobtok, Full Intention, Majestic, and R3HAB have pushed her into international territory, while millions of streams and support from major UK media have built a solid foundation. Magazines from <em data-start="21499" data-end="21513">Rollacoaster</em> to <em data-start="21517" data-end="21529">Wonderland</em> have spotlighted her trajectory, and her singles consistently climb global charts from the UAE to the Billboard Dance Chart.</p>
<p data-start="21658" data-end="21948">Now, <em data-start="21663" data-end="21668">Red</em> marks the moment her sound matures into something more textured. Fans of Tate McRae, Rita Ora, Mabel, Olivia Rodrigo, and Gracie Abrams will find easy entry. But this era feels distinctly Allegra—cooler, richer, and poised for the shift from rising talent to undeniable presence.</p>
<h2 data-start="21955" data-end="22016"><strong data-start="21958" data-end="22014">Janet Devlin — Not My First Emotional Rodeo (Deluxe)</strong></h2>
<p data-start="22031" data-end="22457">Janet Devlin has always written like someone handing over pages torn straight from her journal, but the deluxe edition of <em data-start="22153" data-end="22183">Not My First Emotional Rodeo</em> opens that door even further. The original album already topped the iTunes Country Chart, yet this expanded version reveals new corners and tensions, stretching her sound from twang-edged swagger to quiet, cinematic introspection. It’s not a reinvention—it’s a deepening.</p>
<p data-start="22459" data-end="23054">From the fiery punch of <em data-start="22483" data-end="22490">Candy</em> to the wounded honesty of <em data-start="22517" data-end="22543">If He Wanted To He Would</em>, Devlin navigates emotional extremes with steady control. <em data-start="22602" data-end="22618">Plastic Pistol</em> sharpens the mood with a darker undercurrent, while <em data-start="22671" data-end="22682">Psycho Ex</em> carries a smirk that conceals its sting. But it’s her stripped-down take on <em data-start="22759" data-end="22772">The Gambler</em> that anchors the deluxe. Recorded live with little more than a guitar, she sings with the weight of someone who understands how silence can hold a story. The performance carries the kind of late-night stillness found in <em data-start="22993" data-end="23009">A Star Is Born</em> or the roadside tenderness of <em data-start="23040" data-end="23051">Nomadland</em>.</p>
<p data-start="23056" data-end="23514">Part of Devlin’s appeal has always been her ability to blend vulnerability with grit. Fans of Kacey Musgraves, Orville Peck, or Noah Kahan will feel immediately at home here, yet Devlin maintains a tonal identity distinct from all three: sharper than Musgraves, more melodic than Peck, and less confessional-pop than Kahan. She writes like someone who has been collecting emotional weather patterns for years and finally decided to map them with precision.</p>
<p data-start="23516" data-end="23849">The deluxe edition isn’t just an expansion—it’s a recalibration of the album’s heartbeat. If <em data-start="23609" data-end="23626">Emotional Rodeo</em> was the forward sprint through heartbreak, confusion, and defiance, this new version is the reflective walk afterward, when adrenaline fades and clarity settles in. It feels more lived-in, more human, and more unguarded.</p>
<p data-start="23851" data-end="24094">For listeners seeking modern country that doesn’t lean into clichés or over-polish, <em data-start="23935" data-end="23974">Not My First Emotional Rodeo (Deluxe)</em> is a full-evening experience—one best consumed in low light, with plenty of room to feel whatever rises to the surface.</p>

<p class="align-center"><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Jasmith Finds the Bright Side on Festive Night</strong></p>
<p class="align-left"><br><br>Festive Night lands with that kind of spark that makes you forget how heavy the world can feel. Singapore's Jasmith keeps things simple on the surface, but there is a quiet intention behind the song's bright pulse. Built on clean production and a hook which nudges you into a good mood before you even notice, the track works the way a scene in a feel-good film does: like that moment in Crazy Rich Asians when the lights warm up, and everything turns soft for a second. It is pop built for actual human joy, not the forced kind.<br><br>He takes care of literally every part of the project himself, and for that, the song has a warm clarity, with an early Lauv or Conan Gray's sweet side to it. The beat has that gentle lift, the vocals sit well in the pocket, and nothing is trying too hard. It's that kind of song where you could slide next to Troye Sivan's lighter singles or any playlist built around nights that go a little later than planned. There's also a hint of that K-pop glow-something you'd hear tucked into the soundtrack of a drama right before the two lead characters pretend they're not falling for each other.<br><br>What makes Festive Night work is how honest it feels about its own job: it wants to give you a few minutes of relief, and it succeeds without leaning on big statements. Jasmith seems aware that cheerful songs can hit just as deep as sad ones when they come from the right place. If this is the first step in a longer path, it's a promising one. The song feels ready for any playlist that needs a lift, and that alone is a solid start for someone carving out their own lane with patience and care.<br><br><strong>Anke Richards — Quiet Fire in Another Realm</strong><br><br>Anke Richards has long occupied that subtle space between whisper and atmosphere, but Another Realm feels like the moment her sound crystallizes into something unmistakably her own. Built in collaboration with Grammy-nominated writer Dante Lattanzi, the single stretches a soft, nocturnal glow across its entire runtime. Richards sings as though the room is dark and you're the only one awake with her-every breath is purposeful, every pause carries its own weight. Her voice hovers just above glassy synths that widen slowly, like light settling across still water at midnight.<br><br>Her rise has been quiet but sure-more than 17 million streams without the flashier trappings of a viral breakout-and this track shows exactly why she's found an audience. She holds the same shadowy spark that fans of Billie Eilish or Tate McRae gravitate towards, except she occupies a gentler emotional register, closer to AURORA's soft luminescence or Daughter's early hushed confessions. Cinematic touches slip into the production almost without notice, giving the track the widescreen stillness of a late-night sci-fi sequence or the eerie calm of a series like Dark.<br><br>It further deepens Another Realm for its connection to Artists for Sea Shepherd-a partnership that makes streams and shares real support for marine conservation, a purpose folded discreetly into the song's atmosphere rather than stamped across it. Richards achieves something rare here: a sound both grounded and weightless, personal and expansive, the kind of track built for late-night drives, headphone nights, and quiet apartments where thoughts are allowed to settle slowly. If this is the energy Richards is carrying into 2025, it marks the beginning of a powerful stretch. Another Realm doesn't shout; it settles, it glows, and it lingers. In a year already crowded with maximalist pop, her ability to pull listeners inward might be the exact calm listeners return to again and again.<br><br><strong>Hellkern Warriors — The Pulse of the Void </strong></p>
<p>Hellkern Warriors arrived in 2025 not so much with a launch as with a rupture-a darkwave signal slicing through static from three continents at once. Formed around early sketches from Tom Radar, the group expanded quickly into a full-scale electronic-gothic hybrid when Kabal, Mauricio, and Fabian added their own weight and atmosphere. What began as a handful of shadowy demos-Hellkern Warriors, Petrol &amp; Water, Endless Road-grew into a conceptual world they now call The Pulse of the Void, a sonic space defined by analog synth grit, cold guitar lines, and a heartbeat that moves like machinery learning to feel. Their name references a computer worm, fitting for a band that moves quietly through the dark but cuts unmistakable tracks in their wake. Their debut video, released September 2025, set the tone with stark, minimal visuals and a sound that feels equally suited for late-night playlists, underground basements, or the neon-tinged melancholy of films like The Crow or Underworld. The follow-up single, Petrol &amp; Water, pushed deeper into their signature cold glow.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="3442" data-end="3968">Each member arrives with a history that shapes the project’s depth. Tom Radar’s previous work in RADARFIELD built an international following with its careful balance of emotion and electronic precision. Kabal—also known as Dylan Phoenix—has decades behind him across metal, goth, and EBM scenes, giving Hellkern its poetic tension and sharpened edges. Meanwhile, Colombian musicians Fabian and Mauricio bring a heavy discipline from their metal roots, grounding the project’s electronic pulse with a sense of physical force.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="3970" data-end="4373">The result is a sound that lands somewhere between the chill of Boy Harsher, the brooding minimalism of She Past Away, and the slow-burn tension found in retro-leaning shows like <em data-start="4149" data-end="4166">Stranger Things</em>. It’s early days for Hellkern Warriors, but they already carry the clarity of a band that knows its terrain. These tracks hit like headlights on an empty highway—steady, ghostly, and impossible to ignore.</p>
<p class="align-left" data-start="4375" data-end="4519">If <em data-start="4378" data-end="4401">The Pulse of the Void</em> is only the beginning, then Hellkern Warriors are carving out a realm listeners will want to inhabit for a long time.</p>

<p class="align-left" data-start="4526" data-end="4580"><strong>Chris Oledude — Turning Tables, Turning Heads</strong><br><br>Chris Oledude has long been a sharp, steady voice for when conversations get complicated, but Turning Tables feels like a moment where message and groove meet in perfect balance. The third single from his debut album Preacher Man Vol. 1, the track hits with a confident, unhurried funk that moves with the bounce of early Curtis Mayfield while carrying the warmth of New York street-corner soul. Featuring a vibrant duet with Lindsey Wilson, the song plays like two friends trading truths at a block party—fiery, playful, and urgent.<br><br>What really makes Turning Tables hit even harder, though, is the path it traveled to get here. Sparked originally by writer Dr. Lora Ellen McKinney, the track moved through Oledude's live shows, rewrites, and long, careful studio sessions across Woodstock and lower Manhattan before settling into its final form. You can hear that lived-in quality throughout: backing vocals filled by friends and longtime collaborators, instrumentation that feels played rather than arranged, and a rhythm section that carries the easy authority of musicians who have spent decades honing their craft.<br><br>The roots of Oledude run deep. Raised in a home where protest songs lived beside folk and pop, he developed early on an instinct for music that speaks plainly while still moving with joy. His 1984 cassette Anyone's Revolution already hinted at the voice he would eventually grow into, and his years of civic engagement only sharpened the urgency and compassion layered into his new work. Now, returning fully to art after loss and reflection, he sounds clearer and more grounded than ever.<br><br>Turning Tables also serves as an entrance into the greater universe of Preacher Man Vol. 1, an album that represents forty years of writing, yet feels strikingly present. It fits seamlessly beside Brittany Howard's "Stay High," The Roots' "You Got Me," or the soulful narrative style that carries through Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing.<br><br>Oledude isn't chasing trends; he's building a lane rooted in rhythm, truth, and community. On Turning Tables, that lane feels wide open.<br><br><strong>Agent of Kaos (AOK) — Voltage Rising</strong><br><br>Agent of Kaos, better known across the EDM circuit as AOK, has reached 2025 with a fire he's no longer interested in containing. A familiar name within the Musosoup community, he has always made solid, high-energy tracks, but he's also the first to say they were warm-ups. Now, he's pivoting into a months-long blitz of releases aimed squarely at the dance floor: heavier, sharper, more chaotic, and more precise. Coming out of Denver-a city where bass culture runs through venues like an underground current-AOK is stepping into this new phase with unmistakable purpose.<br><br>His foundations lie in bass-driven production, but he refuses to stay caged by genre. Instead, he treats bass as a launchpad, pushing into festival-scale drops, left-turn structures, and atmospheric builds that echo industry giants like RL Grime, Kayzo, and early Skrillex without ever falling into mimicry. There's a rawness embedded in his sound-a willingness to distort, break, and rebuild patterns-that places him in the rising crowd alongside Rezz, Subtronics, and ISOxo.<br><br>Beyond his own output, AOK leads Church Of Us Records, a label built to amplify new producers navigating an industry that often buries fresh voices under algorithms and noise. His commitment to creating community over clout hints at the long game he's playing: not just momentary impact, but sustained movement.<br><br>AOK's new run leans into the cinematic too, music that mirrors the neon fever of Blade Runner 2049 or the pulsing energy of the Arcane soundtrack. He builds tension with the confidence of someone who knows exactly when the floor will fall out and precisely how the crowd will respond. If you're preparing for what's next, cue him up beside Rezz's darker cuts or ISOxo's explosive drops. This new era is built for late nights, sweat-soaked rooms, and that communal electricity that hits the moment the beat snaps into place. Whatever AOK delivers next, one thing is clear: it's going to be loud.</p>

Based between Prague and Kent, Draper forged her artistry through discipline and reinvention-starting in law before throwing herself full-time into composition under Milan Tesar. Early acclaim arrived with Portraits in Guitar, a record that captured both radio and print across Europe, consolidating her as a guitarist capable of striking clarity. But Draper would never stay there. Her next project, Silence of Eclipse, pushed deeper into mood and narrative: a mix of the intimacy of acoustic lines with discreet modern touches redolent of the quiet tension of Gustavo Santaolalla or the spacious, emotional landscapes of Ryuichi Sakamoto. To listen to Draper is to watch light shift across a room-slow, precise, deeply evocative. Her music could sit inside a Denis Villeneuve film or in the shadowy emotional framework of a series like Dark, where sound becomes an invisible storyteller. Draper's recent collaborations show just how fluidly she moves between worlds. Working with GRAMMY-winner Alexx Antaeus and producer Jon Kennedy, she brings her guitar into clean electronic and downtempo spaces to create a blend that feels organic rather than forced. It's the same balance that artists such as Nils Frahm or Bonobo achieve-acoustic warmth acting as the anchor that holds electronic layers steady. Her award-winning pieces, Espanola and Canzonetta dell’Acqua, are markers of creative clarity rather than arrival. Draper writes with intent but never with a straitjacket; she lets silence, breath, and restraint become part of the composition. Whether crafting meditative solo work or stepping into projects with an electronic lean, she maintains an unmistakable voice: grounded, emotional, and quietly luminous. Those for whom solace has been found in Max Richter's Sleep, Sakamoto's async, or the softer outlines of Tycho will feel instantly at home in Draper's catalog. Her music isn't built for quick thrills-it rewards slow listening, attentive moments, and rooms where quiet feels like its own instrument. Draper stands firmly in the middle of a new movement: artists who understand that calm carries power.<br><br>Pointe — Guard Rails and the Art of Tension Brisbane's rising alt-indie outfit Pointe arrive with Guard Rails, a debut single that already carries the grip of a band well beyond their years. Formed in high school and now stepping into a wider spotlight, the quartet-Rose Fogarty, Evander Adams Post, Jude Spann, and Jake Park-craft a sound built on soft tension, emotional clarity, and the kind of raw intuition that young bands rarely capture this early. Guard Rails centers on a moment suspended between dread and change-the uneasy stretch before life shifts direction. Fogarty's voice pulls that feeling forward with a mix of fragility and insistence. She doesn't belt; she bears weight quietly, the way Dolores O'Riordan once could, or the way Interpol's Paul Banks let cold, steady cadence carry whole scenes. The band wraps her in atmospheric restraint: patient drums, a close-mic'd piano, bass that moves with intention, and guitar lines that slip in like unanswered questions. Listeners might hear echoes of Daughter's early work or the moodier corners of Wolf Alice, but Pointe carve their own shape in the quiet. Paul Blakey's mastering adds a spacious minimalism that lets tiny details land with force-a breath, a tremble, a shift in tone. Despite their youth, Pointe have already packed out rooms at The Cave Inn, a testament to the immediacy of their live presence. Their shows carry that same balance of vulnerability and precision, a push-pull of softness and pressure. It's not flashy; it's intimate. And intimacy tends to travel far. If you're building a playlist around Guard Rails, pair it with The National's Trouble Will Find Me, Wet Leg's gentler cuts, or the drifting neon melancholy of a Gregg Araki soundtrack. Pointe occupy that hazy territory where fear turns into motion and where hesitation becomes the spark for something new. As their debut EP approaches, Guard Rails stands as both a beginning and a promise. Pointe are learning how to turn tension into melody-and they're doing it with startling control.<br>
