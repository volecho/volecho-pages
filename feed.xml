                <p class="align-center">Brandon Castillo, or Cas the Don as he is better known, has been steadily cultivating a varied musical identity that encompasses smooth R&amp;B, intellectually stimulating hip hop, and even neo-soul-infused narratives. His latest track release, What’re We to Do, which came out at the end of 2025, encapsulates this diversity as it seamlessly weaves together social commentary and self-reflection. This is part of a series of releases in promotion of his forthcoming album, titled Faceted.<br><br>The song begins with a staccato, even jarring, metaphor that sets the tone for the rest of the song: “Going through life while someone poking us with a stick / put their tongue on our ice cream ‘fore we got a lick.” Castillo establishes in the first line that life is a world that is working to subvert and oppress its citizens. “Jobs not over til we’re truly free” and “Is it selfish to ask for more, or is it what I was born to be?” suggest a complex interplay of ambition, morality, and strength in a world that is not always supportive. The chorus, “Too much shit to lose, ain’t no time to snooze,” is a call to action that goes far beyond the song itself.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1JNjn97PrqeLES2F563KvE?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>"What're We to Do" sets itself apart not only in its lyrics but in its visual storytelling as well. The album cover is presented as a retro-style front page of a newspaper called "The Freedom Chronicle," and it drops the listener into a world of growing international conflicts and humanitarian crises. The Statue of Liberty looming in the background among ruins suggests the vulnerability of freedom itself, and the chorus "All this on the news? Why we gotta choose?" encapsulates how macro-level events filter down into an individual level of reflection. The song very clearly places itself within the current moment of U.S. airstrikes in Yemen and uprisings around Africa and the Middle East but is also very intimate in its questioning of how one perseveres in moral and emotional ways within an unmoored world.<br><br>Musically, Cas the Don draws from Lauryn Hill, incorporating neo-soul elements, harmonies, and delivery that ranges from conversational to poetic. The production allows for each word to fully resonate, finding balance between the flow and the meaning. Even in more aggressive moments, like in the final word of the final line, “Why bite when I can smell the fear in you?” Castillo exercises self-control and composes herself.<br><br>The career of Cas the Don has been consistently on the rise. Since his debut SoundCloud uploads in 2020, with debut singles such as “I Know” and “Be Calm,” and more recent tracks such as “Nobody Listening” and “Heritage,” he has cultivated a loyal fan base. “Keep It Goin,” his bittersweet single, appeared in Honk Magazine, and “Inner Machinations of My Mind,” his EP, addressed political, social, and personal struggles with a level of sophistication that is not often present in debut releases by an artist so young. More recent releases, such as “Partier” and “Insurance,” demonstrate Castillo's awareness of mainstream appeal and lyrical sophistication.<br><br>"What’re We to Do" is more than a song, more than a critique and more than an anthem—it’s all these things and more. In a world where inflation, real estate, climate change, and politics have become a way of life, Castillo urges listeners to think not just about resilience and justice, but also about what happens on a daily basis, and what kind of choices one makes as an individual, as a human being, and as a member of society.

                <p class="align-center">Antonio David, a French singer-songwriter, comes back with a very intimate track, “Entre tes mains,” released on January 5th, 2026. Born in Angers, David has produced a track that exudes a great deal of soul and introspection, as well as a desire to push the boundaries offered by modern production techniques.<br><br>Completely recorded in his hometown using only his phone, “Entre tes mains” is a lesson in subtlety and restraint. Underlying it all, of course, is a meeting of soothing piano and passionate saxophone that is as immediate as it is eternal. Every note is precisely placed to complement the lyrics that map the contours of longing and regret without ever venturing into soap operatic territory.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1JNjn97PrqeLES2F563KvE?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>What is unique about this release is Antonio's use of technology for artistic purposes. Working with AI technology that assists with lyrics, Antonio combines his experiences with modern technology, creating a story that is specific, poignant, and meaningful. The combination of human emotion with technology assistance comes off as intentional rather than novelty-seeking, which is a testament to an artist open to innovation yet grounded in storytelling.<br><br>*Entre tes mains* is a prime example of a balance between vulnerability and complexity. The vocal performance of David is both delicate and refined, moving the story forward with a sense of truth. The interplay of the sax and piano creates a sense of grandeur to frame the song, drawing the listener into a space where the emotion can be experienced to the fullest. The arrangement of the song has a cinematic quality to it, much like a jazz ballad, yet it is very much rooted in the time it is created.<br><br>For those listeners who enjoy music which is both reflective and well-crafted, *Entre Tes Mains* will prove to be a compelling listen. The minimalistic recording style, combined with the innovative writing of lyrics, indicates a confident artist who isn’t afraid to take a different route. Antonio David remains a testament to the fact that songwriting from the heart and experimenting with technology do not have to be at odds. "Entre tes mains" is a highlight in his journey so far—a single that lingers long after its last note has faded away.</p>

                <p class="align-center">Tony Frissore has always straddled worlds, and his current single, Four Walls, is an expression of this restless curiosity turned inward. Released in 2025 as the last installment of a seven-track set recorded on the road, Four Walls represents a moment of solitude—a feeling of being on the move but alone in your own company. It is a contemplative song but not a sad one, and it maintains its rhythmic pulse even as it explores intimacy.<br><br>As an artist, producer, and long-time aficionado of the genre, Tony’s own personal history is as diverse as the music he creates. From Boston to the jazz scene of New Orleans, and then on to the clubs of the European mainland to network with other DJs and nightclub owners, Tony’s global perspective is reflected in the diverse rhythms and elements of the many styles of music he weaves into his own works. Today, Tony is currently performing as the frontman for the Cleveland-based group Pop Avenue while pursuing his own solo career as an artist.<br><br>Four Walls is at a calmer crossroads of his sound. While tracks such as Just Fade Away and The Eagle Has Landed reach out with energetic urgency and directness, Four Walls looks inward, celebrating the feelings of being enclosed both physically and emotionally. This is a track whose production is full of the dynamics of both motion and stasis at the same time, with delicate electronics underscoring quiet reflection and fleeting memories in the midst of the rush of traveling. It's a track that is very filmic, like the view of the city through the window of a hotel room at night.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/09qTJTEgJU2ivPZhvPjZvD?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>Frissore’s work has international reach. His songs have been featured on MTV, Discovery, TLC, HGTV, OWN, and the DIY Network, and Shazammed in more than 150 countries, which shows a rare talent for speaking to everyone while still having a unique voice. *Four Walls*, on the other hand, is a very personal work. It shows a producer with the talent to create both public and private spaces.<br><br>This single is a product of his very productive 2025, in which he produced singles such as Know Yourself, Stand for Freedom, Self Soothe, and Bad Strategies. Through all of these, he is able to shift easily from one genre to another, whether it is EDM, hip-hop, or even the more contemplative down-tempo genre, with years of experience under his belt, from his earlier work in 2008 with The Übermix to his Quarantine Chronicles in 2020. However, Four Walls is unique in its simplicity and emotional depth.<br><br>Listeners familiar with Frissore’s discography will know his unique combination of groove, texture, and melody. Newcomers to his music will find a song that is both intimate and sophisticated, a song that is reflective while also having enough rhythmic propulsion to recall that it is music written by someone who understands the road, both physically and figuratively. "Four Walls" is a subtle gem in a vast discography. It is a reminder that in the midst of movement, sound, and the global, it is important to look inward, to observe, to listen, and to create a space where the world recedes and all that is left is the sound and the mind.</p>

                <p class="align-center">"OH COME" slotted right in with the rest of Mann’s oeuvre, which extends over two decades and two dozen albums.

The strength of the song is in its subtlety: it is a song that invites the listener to pause, listen, and respond to the invitation to honor the season.<br><br>The gentle voice and production of Mann make the song as fitting for personal listening as it is for corporate worship, distilling the heart of the Christmas story without pretense. It is an important reminder that sometimes the most powerful moments of music and faith come through the power of spontaneity and simplicity.<br><br>What Eddy Mann has created with "Oh Come" is something far greater than a Christmas song; it is a musical moment which captures the quiet joys and reflections at the heart of the season. This is music which is certain to live on year after year as both celebration and meditation.</p>

                <p class="align-center">Whiskey, Ghosts, and Memories does not hurry to get its point across. This six-track EP from Ron the Trucker has the tempo of one who has lived with these stories for long enough to understand that they are not going to fade away simply because you tell them once. This record, which has its foundations in country and Americana, has more of the feel of a chat that takes place late at night.<br><br>Right from the start, it is apparent that this record is intended to be listened to from start to finish. Each song segues nicely into the next, creating an imperfect but deliberate trajectory that follows love, loss, faith, and the quiet accounting of time. These songs are not ones intended to be listened to in isolation. They function best as chapters, each lending weight to those preceding it. In the end, the listener has not only absorbed these songs, but has inhabited an emotional space.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/218to8VPosk7vmuBroznOF?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><br><br>The writing in the songs of Ron the Trucker is steady and sure. His songs value clarity over cleverness; they state what they have to say directly and in a straightforward way. There is no flowery language in the songs of Ron the Trucker; the words are plain but not empty of meaning. Every word in the songs of Ron the Trucker seems to be well-earned. There is a definite sense of place in the songs of Ron the Trucker; not just physical place but also a sense of a place in the heart where the noise has receded.<br><br>The recording reflects that level of control. Everything is in its proper place, serving the tales rather than upstaging them. The guitars have a played-in quality. The beats are contemplative. Breathing room is given to exist between the phrases, allowing a word to sink in completely before the next idea comes along. It is a reminder of a day when country and Americana albums relied on the song to carry the load.<br><br>What’s most striking, however, is that these songs have a level of emotional realism that’s quite rare. “Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories” isn’t an album that tries to sentimentalize hardship or paper over regret. It’s one that lets faith and doubt occupy the same space. There’s loss, but not in a way that’s traumatic or dramatic. There’s love that’s complicated and lasting, not simplistic and absolute.<br><br>On a spiritual level, the EP fits right in with other minimalist albums by artists such as Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and other songwriters in more contemporary circles who prefer a narrative first approach. There’s a certain element to the record that resonates with films that exist in a state of dialogue over action, in which the meaning is found in the quiet instead of the loud.<br><br>Ron the Trucker’s biography is important. As an independent artist, Ron the Trucker’s work is influenced by long hours and hard work and the experiences of personal loss. His songs demonstrate an awareness of the world and its experiences. There is no hype. There is no downplaying. The songs flow as if you were having a discussion with someone who knows enough to talk carefully.<br><br>The fact that he has founded Broken Soul Records, LLC, in Georgia, and that it is a company that distributes his music, further emphasizes that it is not his intention to produce mainstream music. This artist definitely stands by his ideals of artistic expression and honesty, rather than striving to produce something refined and popular. Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is perfect for listeners who appreciate albums as a complete work, and not necessarily as a compilation of hooks. It will appeal to listeners of introspective country, singer-songwriter albums, and Americana that is based upon storytelling as opposed to spectacle. It is also perfect for playlists and environments where the emphasis is upon meaning and truth as opposed to sound. This EP doesn’t aim to change the world. It undertakes something much more subtle and much harder. It listens to itself and speaks out from it. This gives Ron the Trucker a record that has a solid, lived-in feel to it, and it rings true. If you are looking to hear music that understands the gravity of memories and the solace of telling the truth, then Whiskey, Ghosts and Memories is certainly worth your time.</p>

                <p data-start="56" data-end="402">Joey P. closes out 2025 by tightening his focus rather than widening the frame. MISSING IN ACTION is a short release, just two tracks, but it says more about his current headspace than a full album might. After a year that included viral momentum and serious streaming numbers, this feels like a controlled step forward, confident and deliberate.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="56" data-end="402"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2a1dff70K0i5OZXBkYQOzZ?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p data-start="56" data-end="402"> </p>
<p data-start="404" data-end="968">Only One leans into clean pop instincts, polished vocals riding a smooth, bright production that recalls early Justin Bieber singles before pop fully blurred into EDM. It is catchy without trying too hard, the kind of track that slides easily onto radio playlists or late afternoon drives. Then comes Wrong With You, which shifts the lights down. The beat slows, the tone darkens, and Joey sinks back into R and B, letting space and restraint do the heavy lifting. His voice sits closer to the listener here, revealing cracks and questions rather than hooks alone.</p>
<p data-start="970" data-end="1387" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Production from Sandro Carr and Mr. Igotbars keeps both songs focused and modern, never cluttered. The contrast works because it feels honest. Fans of artists like Giveon, early The Weeknd, or Justin Timberlake’s moodier cuts will recognize the balance. MISSING IN ACTION plays like a short film with two scenes, one sunlit, one after midnight. It leaves you curious about what comes next, which is exactly the point.</p>

                <p>Wōndering on Giants embodies the tradition of songwriting while never being bound by it. With acoustic guitars, rhythmic patterns, and lyrics, it’s a contemplation of landscape and identity with a soothing voice. There’s a presence of the Highland landscape and the openness of Montana, but it’s not one of drama, just of quiet presence.</p>

<p><br><br>The music is played with a sense of control. There are gentle weavings of guitars, and the keyboards and basses are complementary and do not compete with the other instruments. The rhythm section is driving the music at a comfortable tempo. The production is warm and has a real sense of being performed. It has the introspective feel of Nick Drake or John Martyn or Van Morrison at his earliest.<br><br>What is most apparent, though, is the songwriting emphasis. The lyrics are significant in these instances, conveying meaning in a way that doesn’t rely on the superfluous. There’s a feeling of cyclical time, a meeting of the past and the present in terms of vision.</p>
<p>Those listeners who respond to the records of the mid sixties through the seventies, for instance, will find a familiarity in this song that doesn’t rely on imitation.</p>

                <p>“Lost My Way Home” has a heavy calmness to it, one that relies more on atmosphere than spectacle. The Night Wolf-produced track establishes a cinematic feel, with the end and texture creating a broad, dark background. The vocal delivery by Lois Powell is direct and sincere, with no strain or emphasis on drama. While it's about accepting and persevering, it never comes across as preachy. Rather, it's an unfolding piece that relies on mood for storytelling.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2ZG439LjY39kjc6JcROx8l?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The trip hop beats are juxtaposed with alt-pop and ambiance, and it's a sound that's at once close and expansive. It wouldn't have been amiss in the company of Massive Attack, London Grammar, or the more subdued tracks by Portishead. There is definitely a sense of territory being staked out here, particularly with the start of the record label EscaVolt Records in association with the release. “Lost My Way Home” is definitely a declaration of intent – and it is a declaration that will immediately appeal to those with an interest in film scores and late night play lists. It is music that is like a scene in a film and not just a song.</p>

                <p>Martin Howard’s latest guitar solo sounds like the pause button on a remote control pressed at just the right time. Recorded on a fifty-year-old classical guitar, it has a warm and clean sound, each note ringing out fully before the next one comes. There is definitely a classical background to this writing, but it never sounds formal. Folk patterns and contemporary flourishes keep it earthed.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5f83vtRoIg611zufq6A6ID?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>With the music reflecting the calm radiance of the moonscape painting that inspired it, the performance contains itself enough to allow the melody to speak for itself. Howard knows how to say a lot through a little. It’s a technique that evokes memories of musicians like Michael Hedges or Ry Cooder from way back when, when the guitar was both the rhythm and the vocals.<br><br>In a market that is currently dominated by cover versions and background instrumentals, Howard's commitment to creating new nylon string music is almost welcome. This is music that is better suited to quiet listening environments and is something that could sit alongside the scores by Gustavo Santaolalla or the more subdued sections of classical crossover albums. It is possible to create something emotively resonant with less.<br><br></p>

                <p>John Beckmann approaches “The Mortal Prophets” more like a musical entity than a band. Every record is more about atmosphere and setting, with songs playing like episodes from short stories that take place on the highways of the desert or in dimly lit rooms. “Americana” is there, but it’s not nostalgic. It’s like the guitars are worn, the voices are drifting, and the electronic elements are sneaking into the corners.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3Y2UzZ6Uelgt7zmIuWlZ6R?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>Beckmann’s prose is strongly suggestive. The lyrics draw on mysticism, poetry, and late-night trains of thought, leaving room for interpretation. You can hear nods towards Eno and Fripp in the ambient textures, the constant propulsion of kosmische music beneath it all, and glimmers of Pink Floyd in their earlier incarnation in the melodic lines. But it all comes down with a sense of clarity, never succumbing to abstraction for abstraction’s sake.<br><br>For anyone who likes artists such as Nick Cave, David Sylvian, or the darker side of Talk Talk, there is plenty to immerse oneself in here. The Mortal Prophets are a group whose sounds are perhaps better digested slowly, perhaps late at night, in the same way you might view an old film noir or a well-worn novel.<br><br></p>
