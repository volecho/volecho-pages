It’s raw, it’s wound tightly, and it’s got the power that can only come from experience. We were able to sit down with J-DAKE and discuss the inspiration and process that went into Monster, and the world they are creating through their work.<br><br><strong>The new single, “Monster,” comes with a lot of impact right from the first few seconds. Emotionally, where did you start with this track?</strong><br><br>“Monster” came from a point of trying to escape—not just physically but emotionally as well. It’s that feeling of trying to escape a relationship that’s become toxic and suffocating. I didn’t want to make this sound clean or pretty. I wanted to make this feel like that moment when you finally say something that’s been bottled up inside of you.<br><br><strong>There’s definitely a good balance between the vulnerable and powerful moments in the song. Was that something you set out to achieve?</strong><br><br>Oh, yeah. I didn’t want to write a victim’s song. It’s delicate in spots, but it’s also kind of defiant. The verses are almost spoken, like you’re walking through a dark place and trying not to wake everybody up. Then the choruses just blow their top— not in anger but just to release it. That’s the whole thing.<br><br><strong>There is such a marked change in your vocal delivery in this song.</strong><br><strong>Was this contrast in your delivery intentional?</strong><br><br>Very much so. I wanted the voice to be as much a part of telling this story as the lyrics are. There are times when it shakes, times when it soars. By the time it gets to the bridge, it’s like everything just burns down around it, and what’s left is relief. That soft finish is not weakness; it’s survival.<br><br><strong>It has a personal tone, but it’s also very cinematic. Did you draw any influences from films or visual storytelling?</strong><br><br>Definitely. I mean, I kept thinking of films like "Joker" or "Drive," and the tension, the sense of things building, but not necessarily when it's going to happen. That's the sort of emotional rhythm I enjoy, the idea that silence is as potent as noise.<br><br><strong>In terms of sound, “Monster” is definitely contemporary, yet there is an edge to it that is almost timeless. How would you describe your sound?</strong><br><br>I don’t follow trends. There's something about the unabashed construction of this song—huge guitars, gritty rhythm, and room for feeling. I came from a background of artists who weren’t afraid of being aggressive and personal at the same time. If I had to pinpoint some influences, it would be the emotional intensity of Billie Eilish combined with the heavy sound of Royal Blood or early Linkin Park, but with my own lyrics.<br><br><strong>You’ve said before that your music isn’t meant simply for the radio. What do you think listeners should feel when listening to “Monster”?</strong><br><br>"I hope they feel less alone. This song is for anyone who has ever been stuck, anyone who has ever had to scream their way back into themselves. It's not about being perfect, it's about being honest."<br><br><strong>Now, let’s discuss your background. What led up to the formation of J-DAKE?</strong><br><br>Sort of by accident, to be honest. I began recording music in my bedroom, alone, just messing around. I recorded demos in the middle of the night. I’m from Manchester, which is a city with a lot of grit but a lot of beauty as well. That’s influenced my writing a lot. The ideas evolved into tracks, and then suddenly I’m playing shows across the UK.<br><br><strong>Your concerts are known to be intense and emotional. How important is that connection when you perform live?</strong><br><br>That’s all I need. I aim for precision, sure, but I never want to lose the sense of something unexpected happening. Rock music, to me, is the sense of the human element – where something is believable because of its imperfections.<br><br><strong>Inner conflict, pressure, and identity are themes in your songs. Where do you derive these themes from?</strong><br><br>From life, actually. From trying to figure out who you are in a world that just keeps telling you who you should be. I write about fear, about strength, about wanting to belong and wanting to break away all at the same time. But I also want the music to move people physically, not just emotionally.<br><br><strong>Looking ahead, where do you see your sound evolving?</strong><br><br>I’m fascinated with dynamics – silence and noise, softness and chaos. I would like to keep challenging myself emotionally but also experiment with new textures. “Monster” is only one part of a story. There’s a lot to come, and it only gets darker and brighter. Finally, if someone is hearing J-DAKE for the first time through “Monster,” what do you want them to take away? That it’s okay to confront the dark in yourself. That there’s strength in that process. This song isn’t about being fearless, it’s about being brave enough to feel and still be able to walk forward.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on January 21, 2026</p><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="inverse" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3><p><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://volecho.com/voices-on-the-edge-the-stories-behind-2025s-boldest-sounds/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/100/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-37-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"> Voices on the Edge: The Stories Behind 2025’s Boldest Sounds</h3></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://volecho.com/top-releases-20-10-25/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="content__nav__text">Next Post<h3 class="h5">Top Releases 20-10-25</h3></div><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/101/responsive/Top-Tracks-2xl-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/jlp-strength-in-the-shout/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/78/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-21-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/jlp-strength-in-the-shout/" class="inverse">JLP: Strength in the Shout</a></h4><time datetime="2025-10-21T17:14">October 21, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__newsletter newsletter"><p class="newsletter__note">Get the latest QF news, updates and more delivered<br>directly to your email inbox</p><form>...</form></div><a class="logo" href="https://volecho.com/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/website/transparent-Photoroom-2.png" alt="volecho.com" width="400" height="400"></a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Volecho 2026</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
