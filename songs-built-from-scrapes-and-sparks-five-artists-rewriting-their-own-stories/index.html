His new album, Less Of Me, feels like the direct result of a year spent letting life talk back. When he left Ireland for the US in March, the plan was simple enough. Travel, play shows, write what comes. What he did not expect was the rhythm that took over. More than one hundred gigs in seven months, from tiny rooms to New York staples like Pete's Candy Store and the Bitter End, shaped the songs in real time. Less Of Me sounds like a notebook that kept filling as crowds pushed him toward sharper lines and looser instincts.</p><p data-start="989" data-end="1423">Lane’s alt country touch has always leaned toward the intimate, but here his voice feels clearer. You can hear echoes of early Jason Isbell, the soft sting of Gillian Welch, even hints of Noah Gundersen’s early acoustic grit. The record tracks his route through the American South to New York without forcing any grand arc. Instead, the tone lands somewhere between quiet humor and bare honesty, two things he has always carried well.</p><p data-start="1425" data-end="1801">For listeners who fell for the raw edge of Outer Monologues or the restless spirit of Common Country Misconceptions, this album lands like a natural step. It keeps his fondness for concept records but trades the tighter framing for something looser and more lived in. Fans of Boygenius, Buck Meek, or the sad fun of Big Thief’s acoustic tracks will find a familiar pulse here.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="1425" data-end="1801"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/23HMN3bFOMVYo5Is4C7sxi?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="1425" data-end="1801"> </p><p data-start="1803" data-end="2160">Lane spent 2024 wrapping a run of shows he jokingly called Sad But Tourable, which suits him. He writes the kind of songs that hit harder when he is laughing at himself, like the scene in an A24 film where the main character admits the truth they have been dodging for an hour. Less Of Me leans into that tone without losing the tender weight of his lyrics.</p><p data-start="2162" data-end="2575">His third LP, Multiple Dead Ends, hinted at a shift. This one confirms it. Podge Lane is still working in country, folk, and the sort of indie that feels built for late-night car speakers, but he sounds freer than ever. Less Of Me is not loud, and it is not flashy. It is simply a record made by someone who paid attention long enough to notice what actually matters. And sometimes that is all a good album needs.</p><hr><p data-start="173" data-end="235"><strong data-start="173" data-end="235">A.D.A.M. Music Project Turns Alien Panic Into Rock Theater</strong></p><p data-start="237" data-end="821">A.D.A.M. Music Project has never made music for the background, and their new single They Are Here plays like the moment in a sci-fi film when the sky cracks open and no one is ready. The track pulls from classic alien-heavy games like Halo and Half Life, but the point isn’t nostalgia. This is rock built for impact, driven by Lacy Saunders and her sharp, soaring voice that cuts into the mix with the kind of lift usually heard in heavy metal epics. The guitars shred without slipping into excess, and the synths widen the track until it feels like a chase scene with no clean exit.</p><p data-start="823" data-end="1180">Fans of bands like Starset, Puscifer, or the heavier side of Muse will feel right at home. There is a tension running through the song that recalls the cold dread of films like Arrival or the frantic energy of Doom Eternal’s soundtrack. It hits fast and stays urgent, yet still leaves space for a few theatrical edges that keep the world of the song intact.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="823" data-end="1180"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/19NbQWCfWWDi4gNidk4ooe?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="1182" data-end="1666">AMP has built a catalog that speaks to listeners who want intensity without noise for the sake of noise. The members come from different corners of rock and pop, which gives each track a messy charm, the good kind. They Are Here sounds like a team pushing the volume up until something shakes loose. It is the closest thing rock has right now to gaming lore turned into sound, and it works because the band leans into the absurd fun of the concept without losing the weight behind it.</p><hr><p data-start="1673" data-end="1712"><strong data-start="1673" data-end="1712">Korda Korder Finds Clarity In Grief</strong></p><p data-start="1714" data-end="2207">Goodbye My Friend is the sort of song that slows everything down for a moment. Korda Korder took the spark from a Sam Fender interview, where he spoke about losing someone close, and turned it into a track that feels like a late-night confession passed between friends. There is no grand statement in the writing. Instead, the vocals float over dream pop textures that glow at the edges, similar to Cocteau Twins or early Cigarettes After Sex, where the voice nearly folds into the synth haze.</p><p data-start="2209" data-end="2609">The band has already earned the trust of people like Steve Lamacq and John Kennedy, and it makes sense. Their songs hit with a softness that lingers, the way a Phoebe Bridgers ballad lingers long after the last chord. Goodbye My Friend builds on the pull of What Have You Done and You Still Turn Me Inside Out, but it has a calmer weight to it, as if they let silence work as part of the arrangement.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="2209" data-end="2609"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1SP4UeWJaEOaCJgFi08lyz?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="2611" data-end="3088">Korda Korder formed only a short time ago, yet their tone feels lived in. They write with the grounded ease of acts like London Grammar or Still Corners, artists who know that slow can be powerful when handled with care. This track fits next to films like Aftersun or The Florida Project, quiet stories about love and loss told without rushing the emotion. For a band still defining their place, they already sound like they understand exactly what frequency they want to hold.</p><hr><p data-start="3095" data-end="3131"><strong data-start="3095" data-end="3131">TRALALAS Turns Shadows Into Song</strong></p><p data-start="3133" data-end="3704">Morten Alsinger’s new project TRALALAS arrives with a calm certainty that can only come from someone who lived a full life before stepping back into the room. Ornament, his debut under the name, pulls from decades of sound. You can hear bits of Danish electro-punk roots, slow-burning pop, and the kind of deep tone heard in Leonard Cohen’s later work. The album feels patient, shaped by someone who trusts small choices. It sits in the space between dark pop and stripped-back indie, balanced by Heidi Lindahl’s voice, which moves through the songs with a steady warmth.</p><p data-start="3706" data-end="4179">There is a sense of reflection built into the writing. Alsinger worked outside music for years, then returned through new tools and new company, which gives these nine tracks the mood of someone rebuilding his creative voice with intention and no rush. Fans of Nick Cave’s quieter records or the dreamlike pull of early Beach House will find familiar ground here. Ornament leans into echo, tone, and slow tension, more like the world of film noir than a bright pop release.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="3706" data-end="4179"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6pJyrbbgWrZGIIM7NFk2bP?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="3706" data-end="4179"> </p><p data-start="4181" data-end="4583">The project grew with the help of producer Thomas Li and a small circle of players, which keeps everything tight but never stiff. Winter on the Vine, the first single, sets the tone with a calm undercurrent that would fit neatly beside the closing credits of a moody indie film. Ornament feels like a reminder that music can be heavy without being loud, and that age can add focus rather than limit it.</p><hr><p data-start="4590" data-end="4639"><strong data-start="4590" data-end="4639">Grim Logick Builds A World Out Of Scar Tissue</strong></p><p data-start="4641" data-end="5205">Cipher Chronicles: The Network Archives is the kind of record you feel before you understand it. Grim Logick and iLLLogick turn their own history into a 10-track blast of Dark Orchestral Trap that pulls from pain, survival, and the sharp grind of years spent outside the industry’s clean paths. Recorded in Baton Rouge and shaped in a space they built piece by piece, the album carries the raw tone of early Tech N9ne mixed with the cinematic pull of Run The Jewels at their most focused. Every track seems to push back against a world that tried to shut them out.</p><p data-start="5207" data-end="5648">The concept is shaped by a digital narrator and the sense that these artists are writing their past and future at the same time. Fans who like the grit of City Morgue, the cold weight of Clipping., or the emotional punch of Denzel Curry’s slower tracks will lock in quickly. The production leans on strings, choir hits, and drums that sound like they were recorded in a room too small for their volume, all adding to the feeling of pressure.</p><p class="align-center" data-start="5207" data-end="5648"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1JrvTvesMYmlbSx1X1ildu?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p data-start="5650" data-end="6150">What makes the project land is the honesty. This is music built from illness, family strain, and the grind of starting with nothing. Yet it avoids pity and instead finds a strange energy in the fight itself. The album plays like a graphic novel soundtrack, the kind you would hear under a scene from Into the Spider-Verse or an intense moment in a Dark Souls cutscene. Grim Logick raps with a tone that feels less like performance and more like he is giving you the truth without softening the edges.</p><p data-start="6152" data-end="6293">Cipher Chronicles is loud, tense, and human. You can tell it was made by people with something real to protect. That is what gives it weight.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 17, 2025</div><div class="content__footer__col"><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/top-releases-111725/" class="invert" rel="prev">Top Releases 11/17/25</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="invert" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/hellrazor-frostbitten-riffs-and-riot-ready-metal-rising-from-the-north/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/74/responsive/volecho-music-magazine-18-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/hellrazor-frostbitten-riffs-and-riot-ready-metal-rising-from-the-north/" class="invert">HELLRAZOR: Frostbitten Riffs and Riot-Ready Metal Rising from the North</a></h4><time datetime="2025-10-20T00:53">October 20, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/moletrap-find-their-voice-with-mid-welsh-pt-1/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/31/responsive/moletrap-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/moletrap-find-their-voice-with-mid-welsh-pt-1/" class="invert">Moletrap Find Their Voice With Mid Welsh, Pt 1</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T12:26">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/new-music-by-vanarin/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Untitled-design-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/new-music-by-vanarin/" class="invert">VANARIN’s Mesmerizing New Release: A Taste of Their Upcoming Third Album</a></h4><time datetime="2025-01-07T00:40">January 7, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright 2025</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
