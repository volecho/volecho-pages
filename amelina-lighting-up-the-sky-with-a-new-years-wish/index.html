Into that moment steps Amelina, the Russian-born, Spain-based pop-rock newcomer whose new single “A New Year’s Wish” captures the quiet courage of starting over. Out October 30, 2025, the track is a radiant mix of bright guitars, crisp percussion, and vocals that rise like fireworks over the horizon. It’s both cinematic and deeply human, a song about shaking off fear and finding magic in uncertainty.</p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/R40cshjn/IMG-4612.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="IMG-4612" border="0"></p><p>At first listen, "A New Year's Wish" sounds like it's reaching for the stars, but its power lies in the details: the shimmer of a chord, the lift of a melody that feels like hope in motion. There's a touch of early Avril Lavigne's sparkle in the guitars, a trace of Kelly Clarkson's anthem-sized delivery, and the storytelling clarity of Olivia Rodrigo or Sabrina Carpenter. But Amelina's voice carries something all her own: a kind of bright defiance that comes not from confidence but from survival. The song builds slowly from what's almost a whisper to a chorus that feels like it's been waiting all year to arrive. "It's like fireworks," Amelina says. "It starts quiet, then bursts into color and reminds you how alive you are." That image fits her music perfectly: emotion and adrenaline intertwined, a flare sent into the dark sky just to remind you that light always returns.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2KB8CcoEbyUA0hP58619Iu?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br>Amelina's story is threaded through that same mix of fragility and strength. When she moved from Russia to Spain in 2023, she left behind a familiar language, a music scene she knew, and the sense of safety that comes with routine. What she found instead was a new kind of creative urgency. Alone in a new city, she began writing songs that mirrored her life — not grand statements, but little affirmations, notes to self set to melody. You can hear that growth between her early tracks such as "Step by Step" and "Roblox Realms," blending indie pop with flashes of rock and cinematic sheen.<br>On "A New Year's Wish," she sounds like an artist who has finally found her rhythm. The production sparkles but never feels polished to emptiness; there's breath and texture in every measure. You can sense her background as both dreamer and realist, someone who knows life doesn't turn around with one song but still believes in trying. The chorus, with its call to "let the light back in," could sit comfortably beside Taylor Swift's 1989 era or the more pop-leaning work of Paramore, yet it lands with a sincerity that keeps it grounded.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/wFw3BLNW/NY-Wish-1.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="NY-Wish-1" border="0"></p><p>Refreshingly, Amelina doesn't treat vulnerability as weakness. In an age of algorithmic confidence and curated perfection, she leans into feeling too much. Her lyrics don't posture; they process. Every song feels like a voice note sent to the future self that might need to hear it. There's something courageous in that simplicity: a belief that truth doesn't need to shout.<br><br>Listening to "A New Year's Wish" is like watching a film about your own life, one where the ending isn't tied in a bow but full of possibility. It's easy to imagine it soundtracking some coming-of-age montage or the closing scene of some teen drama-maybe something halfway between Heartstopper and The Edge of Seventeen. There's a sincerity here that modern pop sometimes forgets, a kind of emotional directness that recalls early 2000s optimism but updated for now.<br><br>Even the holiday undertone feels smartly handled: rather than leaning into tinsel and sleigh bells, Amelina uses the idea of New Year as metaphor-a clean slate, a promise that even after heartbreak or chaos, something luminous can grow again. It's not a holiday song in the traditional sense; it's a human one. What's striking about her recent trajectory is how fast she's learning to balance craft and feeling. There's the clear mark of someone who studies pop structure but trusts instinct more than formula. Each track she's released builds its own small world, linked not by sound but by spirit. Together, they map out a story of growth-from the cautious energy of "Step by Step" to the full-hearted drive of "A New Year's Wish." Her sound has become a kind of cinematic diary: snapshots in motion, always glowing with color and rhythm.<br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on November 9, 2025</div><div class="content__footer__col"><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://volecho.com/michelle-breathe-acoustic/" class="invert" rel="prev">Michelle – “Breathe (Acoustic)”</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" class="invert" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/interview-with-neverskin/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/36/responsive/Untitled-design-3-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/interview-with-neverskin/" class="invert">Interview with Neverskin</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T13:13">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/eleri-ward-steps-into-her-own-with-internal-rituals/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/35/responsive/Untitled-design-2-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/eleri-ward-steps-into-her-own-with-internal-rituals/" class="invert">Eleri Ward Steps Into Her Own With Internal Rituals</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-29T13:05">September 29, 2025</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://volecho.com/tralalas-find-fire-in-the-fragile-with-burns/"><img src="https://volecho.com/media/posts/33/responsive/Untitled-design-1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://volecho.com/tralalas-find-fire-in-the-fragile-with-burns/" class="invert">TRALALAS Find Fire in the Fragile With “Burns”</a></h4><time datetime="2025-09-16T12:41">September 16, 2025</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright 2025</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
