This is honed pandemonium with hooks that cling long after the amps have been killed. HELLRAZOR takes an inspiration from the height of metal's hard-core roots, i.e., the raw power and boorish energy of early Priest or Metallica — but carries it forward to the modern era with the fire and attitude of modern rock and metalcore. You have fist-raising anthems designed for smoke-filled clubs, tattooed fists raised aloft, screams intended to be yelled by strangers who become gang members for a moment.<br><br>Their sound alternates between storm-bringer fury and unadulterated, over-the-top, cinematically-informed melodrama, in effect, a soundtrack to a motorbike gang arriving at the end of the world with lightning-filled skies and no plans on losing their momentum. There's intensity to the performance, but no slouching; the band is well aware of when to tighten the bolt and when to let the fury unleash.<br><br>That campy bite? That's vibe, that's not camp. Consider Ghost's horror-fixture showmanship meeting Avenged Sevenfold's punch-in-the-face brutality of early days. Riffs cut like a knife, choruses blaze like fire. No ballads. No filler. Just intent on steroids.<br><br>HELLRAZOR sounds like the live performance, sweat, strobes, boots thudding over monitors, and a front row full of screamin' fans yellin' out every lyric like they're livin' it. An unworried attitude is spreading throughout, the same one that evokes the hell-bent rebellion of classic metal without going so far as to retro.<br><br>This band is not faking it dressed up in costume as metal. They are metal,living it, bleeding it, and laying it down with enough power to incinerate a frozen town during a blackout. Plug the sound. Turn it up to eleven. If your heart fails to start pounding by the time the chorus kicks in, take your pulse — you may already be in the graveyard.<br><br>But fear not. HELLRAZOR seems to taunt that they are going to give you one last ride.</p><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://volecho.com/authors/emily/" title="Volecho.com">Volecho.com</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"><div class="related"><h2 class="related__title">Related posts:</h2><ul class="related__items"><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/gregg-mckella-space-folk-storytelling-from-the-underground/">Gregg McKella: Space-Folk Storytelling from the Underground</a></h3></li><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/songs-built-from-scrapes-and-sparks-five-artists-rewriting-their-own-stories/">Songs Built From Scrapes and Sparks: Five Artists Rewriting Their Own Stories</a></h3></li><li class="related__item"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://volecho.com/budget-guitars/">From Garage to Studio: Best Budget-Friendly Guitars for Musicians</a></h3></li></ul></div><div class="banner banner--after-content"><hr><h4 class="align-center"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><button class="button button2"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/volechomag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ffffff;">Follow Us On Instagram</a></button></span></h4></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://volecho.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
